Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here take a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs I constitute willing to own hardly know how to get them. Your health sir!,28
Thrushcross Grange is my own sir he interrupted flinch. I should not give up anyone to inconvenience me if I could obstruct itwalk in!,6
What the monster is the topic? he necessitate eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.,21
I take a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,17
They wont meddle with persons who touch nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table. The dogs do right to be vigilant. bring a glass of wine?,23
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master embark on the scene.,20
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and historic period issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understand me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16
Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all meter indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
Here we receive the whole establishment of domestics I suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order.,9
If I had been I would take dress my signet on the biter.,26

My caress harass a long guttural knot.,17
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a darling. Then striding to a slope door he shouted again Joseph!,18

What the devil cost the topic? he asked eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable discussion.,21
Thrushcross Grange cost my own sir he interrupted wincing. I should not let anyone to inconvenience me if I could impede itwalk in!,6
When he saw my knight breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court Joseph take Mr Lockwoods horse and bring up some wine.,8
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I belong home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.

Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dressing table to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he hold an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.

I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and bring in what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.

One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.

He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy.

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster enroll on the fit.,20

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the family in restore peace.,19
I have just hark back from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,2
They wont meddle with persons who affect nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table. The dogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?,23
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I experience no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralia.,13

One step lend us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she film no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering equal a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12

And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16
One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white gem the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot restrain for a pet. Then striding to a english doorway he shouted again Joseph!,18

Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic stylus of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.

Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps so far not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose.

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to necessitate aloud aid from some of the family in reestablishing peace.,19

My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,17
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his restlessness previous to visit the penetralia.,13
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster entered on the view.,20
No wonder the grass develop up between the flags and cattle are the only hedgecutters.,10
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly break into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the beat table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

The walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment Go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation I find interested in a serviceman who look more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.,7
