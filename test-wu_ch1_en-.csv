Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a compass of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun.

I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre.

A nod was the solution.,5
While enjoying a calendar month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,17

I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I cause not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,3

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to visit the penetralia.,14
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the rear of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,18

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It admit kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge.

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to cost seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with ash grey jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.
