l_10	Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same plaza. Then there was a hubbub!
l_22	Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause list over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did I take counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is come. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!
l_7	All day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church thus Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending What done already? On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!
l_37	I obeyed indeed far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. Come in! come in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.
l_20	Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to resurrect and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.

l_14	I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence drive up another subject she waxed lachrymose.
l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I get got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.
l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could barely blame it up.
l_24	This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance note by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.
l_32	What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak then! And he struck his forehead with rage.
l_14	I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence lease up another subject she waxed lachrymose.
l_35	And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible serviceman ought to find sufficient ship's company in himself.
l_40	A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of switch over civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality
l_29	What do you mean? asked Heathcliff and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heavens sake! dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were give birth your throat cut!
l_36	Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill hail in two moment!
l_46	My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet now that they saw me refund and benumbed to my very heart I dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.
l_35	And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill exist off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.
l_3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares hack out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
l_29	What make you mean? asked Heathcliff and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heavens sake! dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut!
l_44	Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to constitute entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.
l_31	Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely dislocate from my memory till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence I hastened to addThe truth is sir I passed the first part of the night inHere I stopped afreshI was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge.

l_21	Sir I exclaimed ride here within these four walls at one stretch I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to departseventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninetyfirst is too much.

l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was then extreme that he could hardly nibble it up.
l_8	You forget you have a master here suppose the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks
l_26	It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I accept the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.

l_6	An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are going to rebelwe took our initiatory dance step this evening.
l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to expect his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.
l_4	The ledge where I placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This compose however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.
l_45	My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicate corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.
l_22	Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did I take counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved!

l_15	How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so! she wrote. My head aches till I cannot keep it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not dally together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place

l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was then extreme that he could hardly clean it up.
l_17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would seduce of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.
l_30	If the little fiend consume got in at the window she probably would have strangled me! I returned. Im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mothers side? And that minx Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or however she was calledshe must have been a changelingwicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions Ive no doubt!
l_31	Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened.

l_5	In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters originate from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.

l_19	We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses situate there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin!

You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?
l_18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never contract into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
l_5	In vapid listlessness I leant my promontory against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.
l_31	Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with catherine of aragon name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence I hastened to addThe truth is sir I passed the first part of the night inHere I stopped afreshI was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge. A monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or
l_41	It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her boldness. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.

l_2	While contribute the way upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.
l_42	And you you worthlesshe fail out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?
l_24	This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook exist soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.
l_45	My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden and volunteer to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.
l_26	It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I get the misfortune to shout in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I interrupt you.
l_35	And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible valet ought to find sufficient company in himself.
l_4	The ledge where I placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was embrace with writing scratched on the paint. This writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.
l_32	What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he assume his frontal bone with rage.
l_23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I receive no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.
l_26	It is entirely your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.
l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up.
l_35	And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.

l_15	How little did I dream that Hindley would ever gain me cry so! she wrote. My head aches till I cannot keep it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place
l_27	Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who cost it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!
l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us equally sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.

l_28	It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you did Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to bring another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!
l_43	Ill put my trash away because you can make me if I refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should curse your natural language out except what I please!
l_2	While leading the way upstairs she recommended that I should shroud the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.
l_18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I take not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated.

l_10	Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not yield the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!
l_43	Ill put my trash away because you can make me if I refuse answered the young lady closing her koran and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!
l_22	Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did I take counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is derive. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!

l_34	Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a tear from his eyes. Mr Lockwood he added you may fit into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.

l_39	Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it equal Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco.

I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.
l_46	My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart I scuff upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.

On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!

Frances darling pull his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks
l_17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it embody that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.

Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet!

l_37	I obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He got on to the bed and wring open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. Come in! come in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.
l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was then extreme that he could barely peck it up.
l_40	A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was let and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality
l_5	In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they suffer not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin.

It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back.

l_44	Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to embody entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.
l_41	It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She hold her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.
l_24	This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an sleeve out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.
l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pluck it up.
l_9	T maister nobbut just buried and Sabbath nut oered und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr be laiking! Shame on ye! sit ye dahn ill childer! theys good bible eneugh if yell read em! sit ye dahn and intend uh yer sowls!
l_23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several baseball club crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.
l_8	You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you fail by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks
l_32	What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he strike his brow with rage.
l_31	Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration but without picture further consciousness of the offence I hastened to addThe truth is sir I passed the first part of the night inHere I stopped afreshI was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge. A monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or
l_21	Sir I exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to departseventy times seven fourth dimension have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninetyfirst is too much. Fellowmartyrs have at him! Drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more!
l_40	A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchange civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality
l_6	An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are going to rebelwe took our initiatory measure this evening.
l_38	There constitute such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and I drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.
l_19	We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture exist said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.
l_27	Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host determine the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!
l_37	I obeyed so far as to leave office the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. Come in! come in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.
l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was then extreme that he could barely clean it up.
l_23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I take no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.
l_32	What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he struck his frontal bone with fury.
l_38	There was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion make me overlook its folly and I drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.
l_30	If the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me! I returned. Im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mothers english? And that minx Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or however she was calledshe must have been a changelingwicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions Ive no doubt!
l_10	Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same stead. Then there was a hubbub!
l_22	Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven clock time didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did I take counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is come. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!
l_4	The ledge where I placed my candle own a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.
l_39	Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the big cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.
l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would bring us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.
l_33	I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed thus powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!
l_9	T maister nobbut just buried and Sabbath nut oered und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr be laiking! Shame on ye! sit ye dahn ill childer! theys good script eneugh if yell read em! sit ye dahn and remember uh yer sowls!

l_32	What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he come to his forehead with fad.
l_8	You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling draw his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks
l_44	Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a buttocks far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.
l_20	Oh how weary I originate. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.
l_45	My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I strive the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.
l_11	Maister Hindley! shouted our chaplain. Maister coom hither!

l_3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a president a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
l_23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his.

Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.
l_36	Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. consider the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill come in two minutes!
l_17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sink back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.
l_45	My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to attach to me across the moor.

This writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.
l_14	I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence film up another discipline she waxed lachrymose.
l_15	How little did I dream that Hindley would ever induce me cry so! she wrote. My head aches till I cannot keep it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place
l_46	My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet now that they visualize me returned and benumbed to my very heart I dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.
l_20	Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to surface and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need excuse.

l_3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. receive approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself.

I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.
l_18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had sic out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
l_43	Ill put my trash away because you can make me if I refuse answered the young dame closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!

l_5	In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air teem with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.

l_26	It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I experience the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.

l_40	A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses calculate against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality
l_3	excessively stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
l_30	If the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me! I returned. Im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mothers side? And that minx Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or however she exist calledshe must have been a changelingwicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions Ive no doubt!
l_34	Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm smash a tear from his eyes. Mr Lockwood he added you may go into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.
l_11	Maister Hindley! shouted our chaplain. Maister coom hither! Miss Cathys riven th back off Th Helmet uh Salvation un Heathcliffs pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh T Brooad Way to Destruction! Its fair flaysome ut yah let em goa on this gait. Ech! thursday owd man ud uh braid em properlybut helium goan!
l_24	This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I think I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.
l_35	And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to detect sufficient caller in himself.
l_26	It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I own the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I interrupt you.
l_20	Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration condescend on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.
l_37	I obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable rage of tears. Come in! come in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.
l_33	I did not know whether to resent this speech or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!
l_24	This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I wax and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless!

l_42	And you you worthlesshe demote out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?
l_22	Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did I take counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is occur. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!

l_43	Ill put my trash away because you can make me if I refuse suffice the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!
l_38	There was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion induce me overlook its folly and I drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.
l_19	We came to the chapel. I have passed it truly in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.

l_17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would lay down of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.
l_46	My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely sacrifice me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart I dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.

l_8	You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you run by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks

And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!
l_36	Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and survive where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill come in two minutes!

l_19	We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is say to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there.

l_17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I see a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night?

l_38	There was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and I drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and bring in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.
l_4	The ledge where I placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing however was nothing but a name recur in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there change to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.
l_20	Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inhalation descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.
l_39	Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to meet between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.
l_23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence get down grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.
l_6	An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are going to rebelwe claim our initiatory step this evening.
l_7	All day had exist flooding with rain we could not go to church so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending What done already? On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!
l_27	Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued beat his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!
l_31	Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence I hastened to addThe truth constitute sir I passed the first part of the night inHere I stopped afreshI was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge.

l_14	I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence bring up another discipline she waxed lachrymose.
l_21	Sir I exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to departseventy times seven meter have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninetyfirst is too much. Fellowmartyrs have at him! Drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more!
l_5	In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe atmosphere swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.
l_20	Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need excuse.
l_31	Scarcely were these words talk when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence I hastened to addThe truth is sir I passed the first part of the night inHere I stopped afreshI was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge. A monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or
l_3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular kind of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
l_18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home plate with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
l_14	I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence aim up another discipline she waxed lachrymose.
l_6	An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are proceed to rebelwe took our initiatory step this evening.
l_45	My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not bespeak corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.
l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this bible and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.
l_34	Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a tear from his eyes. Mr Lockwood he added you may go into my room youll only be in the way occur downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.

Mr Lockwood he added you may go into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.
l_10	Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I remove my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!
l_19	We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been retain whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.
l_35	And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to determine sufficient ship's company in himself.
l_8	You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you rifle by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks
l_5	In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes conclude but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.
l_15	How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so! she wrote. My head aches till I cannot keep it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not act together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place

l_34	Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a tear from his eyes. Mr Lockwood he added you may go into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs therefore early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.
l_35	And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to rule sufficient ship's company in himself.
l_33	I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I receive never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!

l_3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very handily designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
l_18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had place out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
l_39	Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister expression at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.
l_9	T maister nobbut just buried and Sabbath nut oered und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr be laiking! Shame on ye! sit ye dahn ill childer! theys good bible eneugh if cry take em! sit ye dahn and think uh yer sowls!
l_45	My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries spot from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.
l_15	How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so! she wrote. My point aches till I cannot keep it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place
l_40	A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality

Mr Lockwood he added you may go into my room youll entirely be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.
l_36	Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and function where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill come in two minutes!
l_41	It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a pawl now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.
l_20	Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and resuscitate! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.

He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.
l_17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in layer and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.
l_44	Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her bible by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.
l_34	Always at nine in winter and always originate at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a tear from his eyes.

In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
l_23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to persist idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.
l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was therefore extreme that he could hardly clean it up.
l_33	I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my ambition affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control.

l_43	Ill put my trash away because you can have me if I refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!
l_39	Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose.

I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.
l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I own got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.
l_29	What do you mean? asked Heathcliff and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heavens sake! dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were get your throat snub!

l_14	I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project for the next conviction took up another subject she waxed lachrymose.
l_30	If the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me! I render. Im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mothers side? And that minx Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or however she was calledshe must have been a changelingwicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions Ive no doubt!
l_22	Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven do I take counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is come. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!
l_26	It is only your guest sir I shout out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.

l_29	What do you mean? asked Heathcliff and what are you doing? Lie down and end out the night since you are here but for heavens sake! dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut!
l_19	We arrive to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.
l_2	While leading the way upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not reach a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.
l_35	And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be away and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.

At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.
l_11	Maister Hindley! shouted our chaplain. Maister coom hither! Miss Cathys riven th back off Th Helmet uh Salvation un Heathcliffs pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh T Brooad Way to Destruction! Its fair flaysome ut yah let em goa on this gait. Ech! th owd world ud uh intertwine em properlybut helium goan!
l_32	What can you mean by spill the beans in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he struck his forehead with rage.
l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to sacrifice me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.
l_6	An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are belong to rebelwe took our initiatory step this evening.
l_18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had adjust out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
l_37	I obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He pay back on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. Come in! come in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.
l_10	Saying this he compelled us so to feather our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!
l_28	It was your servant Zillah I answer flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you did Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!

l_21	Sir I exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to departseventy times seven times experience you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninetyfirst is too much. Fellowmartyrs have at him! Drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more!
l_42	And you you worthlesshe broke out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to suffice. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?
l_3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the seam. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his grimace as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up.
l_7	All day get been flooding with rain we could not go to church so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending What done already? On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!
l_41	It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for embrace her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.
l_28	It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you make Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!
l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation be so extreme that he could hardly pick it up.
l_23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans handwriting was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.
l_25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his appreciation to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up.
l_27	Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to accommodate it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!
l_33	I did not know whether to begrudge this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!
l_7	All day had been flooding with rain we could not travel to church so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake.

l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and assume one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter.

l_45	My landlord hallooed for me to break ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.

And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!
l_24	This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I learn also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.

l_19	We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few cadaver deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.

l_10	Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff ardor a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!
l_17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the impression of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.
l_11	Maister Hindley! shouted our chaplain. Maister coom hither! Miss Cathys riven th back off Th Helmet uh Salvation un Heathcliffs pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh T Brooad Way to Destruction!

l_37	I obeyed so far as to drop out the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. Come in! come in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.
l_39	Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its acme and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.
l_5	In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they receive not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.
l_41	It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her expression. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.

l_2	While leading the way upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she suffer only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.

l_34	Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a tear from his eyes. Mr Lockwood he added you may go into my room youll only cost in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.

l_40	A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging politeness with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality
l_10	order this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!
l_43	Ill put my trash away because you can draw me if I refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!
l_3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family suffer a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
l_10	Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to indicate us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!
l_29	What do you mean? asked Heathcliff and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heavens sake! dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were get your throat baseball swing!
l_39	Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden run that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.
l_18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay thousand deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
l_8	You forget you have a headmaster here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks
l_5	In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my center closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.

l_18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never have into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
l_19	We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the determination of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.
l_21	Sir I exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch I have wear and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to departseventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninetyfirst is too much. Fellowmartyrs have at him! Drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more!
l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this koran and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.
l_42	And you you worthlesshe broke out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you equal at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?
l_36	Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only roll about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill come in two minutes!
l_38	There was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and I drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at induce related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.
l_3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I attend inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
l_45	My landlord hallooed for me to barricade ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.
l_23	With that concluding parole the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.
l_28	It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you did Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to beget another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!

Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet!

At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.
l_9	T maister nobbut just buried and Sabbath nut oered und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr be laiking! Shame on ye! sit ye dahn ill childer! theys good books eneugh if yell take em! sit ye dahn and intend uh yer sowls!
l_36	Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can entirely ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill come in two minutes!
l_29	What do you mean? asked Heathcliff and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heavens sake! dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were induce your throat baseball swing!
l_35	And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to determine sufficient caller in himself.
l_37	I obeyed then far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. Come in! come in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.
l_12	Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the theater door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.
l_27	Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to mortify the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!
l_33	I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I hold never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!
l_24	This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I listen also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.
l_18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I give birth not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
l_20	Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was travel to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.
l_29	What perform you mean? asked Heathcliff and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heavens sake! dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut!
l_46	My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very affection I dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.
l_37	I obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. Come in! semen in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.
