__label__20	Oh how weary I originate. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst.

__label__3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it imprint a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.
__label__23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel service resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.

The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels.

__label__18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not lend a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.

However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin!

__label__39	Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other.

He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.

__label__46	My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet now that they saw me hark back and benumbed to my very heart I dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.

__label__5	In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they give birth not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.

__label__25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him.

__label__44	Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the fireplace and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.

__label__17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it cost that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.

I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is read to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.

__label__18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I own not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.

I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have become the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter.

At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.

__label__23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I experience no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.

__label__24	This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I heighten and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.

__label__18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never pay back into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.

She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a frank now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.

Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks

__label__17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in bed and decrease asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.

He glanced over the back of the bench elaborate his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat.

__label__23	With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence begin grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.

__label__25	Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was therefore extreme that he could hardly peck it up.
__label__32	What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my ceiling? God! hes mad to speak so! And he struck his forehead with rage.

__label__18	I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a template. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.

__label__33	I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I consume no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!
__label__4	The ledge where I placed my candle had a few mildewed ledger piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.

__label__17	I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in seam and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.

However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.

He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the caterpillar from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.

Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!

I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.

I experience passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.

__label__38	There was such anguish in the gust of grief that attach to this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and I drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension.

Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.

Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row?

It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind.

We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet.

__label__33	I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an mental picture which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet!

The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must break it nevertheless!

How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.

It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.

__label__33	I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it much over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!

Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand exist against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.

__label__3	Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked at heart and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.

However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion.

He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco.
