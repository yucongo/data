Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here take a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs I constitute willing to own hardly know how to get them. Your health sir!,28
Thrushcross Grange is my own sir he interrupted flinch. I should not give up anyone to inconvenience me if I could obstruct itwalk in!,6
What the monster is the topic? he necessitate eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.,21
I take a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,17
They wont meddle with persons who touch nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table. The dogs do right to be vigilant. bring a glass of wine?,23
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master embark on the scene.,20
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and historic period issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understand me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16
Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all meter indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
Here we receive the whole establishment of domestics I suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order.,9
If I had been I would take dress my signet on the biter.,26

My caress harass a long guttural knot.,17
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a darling. Then striding to a slope door he shouted again Joseph!,18

What the devil cost the topic? he asked eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable discussion.,21
Thrushcross Grange cost my own sir he interrupted wincing. I should not let anyone to inconvenience me if I could impede itwalk in!,6
When he saw my knight breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court Joseph take Mr Lockwoods horse and bring up some wine.,8
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I belong home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.

Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dressing table to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he hold an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.

I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and bring in what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.

One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.

He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy.

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster enroll on the fit.,20

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the family in restore peace.,19
I have just hark back from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,2
They wont meddle with persons who affect nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table. The dogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?,23
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I experience no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralia.,13

One step lend us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she film no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering equal a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12

And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16
One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white gem the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot restrain for a pet. Then striding to a english doorway he shouted again Joseph!,18

Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic stylus of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.

Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps so far not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose.

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to necessitate aloud aid from some of the family in reestablishing peace.,19

My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,17
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his restlessness previous to visit the penetralia.,13
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster entered on the view.,20
No wonder the grass develop up between the flags and cattle are the only hedgecutters.,10
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly break into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the beat table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the family and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what cause I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory anteroom or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing breathing they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun.

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my drift.

Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us.

But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and quite morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white tooth watering for a cunt.

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements.

I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I think at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.

Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a pet. Then striding to a english doorway he exclaim again Joseph!,18

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master accede on the setting.,20

One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mouton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all multiplication indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but think they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre.

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the presence and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,13

My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,17
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned itinerant in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to exacerbate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,13
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation consume no address to my unexpected advent.,11
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen cause more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but give no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs sic out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord boost and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,17

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour broadly but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.

Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the goal of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12

I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that go. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,29

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners champion with large stick out gem.,12

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.

Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had give birth some thoughts,5
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and spat. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing public discussion they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar stairs with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you become at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is pull to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to exacerbate his restlessness previous to audit the penetralia.,13

When he saw my horses breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court Joseph consider Mr Lockwoods horse and fetch up some wine.,8
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely sympathize tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees.

Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master accede on the scene.,20

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the recess champion with large jutting rock.,12
One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver medal jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you experience receive some opinion,5

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and induce faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I consume no desire to worsen his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralia.,13
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance go to bed colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp.

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster entered on the scene.,20

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor embody of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a catch.

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he induce an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall survive notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,29
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference book to my unexpected second coming.,11
What the monster be the topic? he asked eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable discussion.,21

In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I depend on up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolving power still further in his vest as I announced my name.,2

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure stimulate ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen seduce more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and precede what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the recess fight with large jutting stones.,12

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and cause faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19

The walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment Go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation I find interested in a man who seemed more hyperbolically reserved than myself.,7
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip coil up and her white teeth watering for a catch.

But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome trope and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

No wonder the pot turn up between the flags and cattle exist the only hedgecutters.,10
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot restrain for a pet. Then striding to a english doorway he exclaim again Joseph!,18
If I had been I would consume set up my signet on the biter.,26
Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I dress myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts,5
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she entirely remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20
Here we have the whole establishment of domestics I suppose was the observation indicate by this compound order.,9
When he saw my horses breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court Joseph consider Mr Lockwoods horse and institute up some wine.,8
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation experience no character to my unexpected second coming.,11
What the devil indeed! I muttered. The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse liquor in them than those animals of yours sir. You might as well exit a stranger with a brood of tigers!,22
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one moment faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was bewilder into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16
Here we have the whole establishment of domestics I suppose was the mirror image propose by this compound club.,9
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who give birth left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,17
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he own an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
What the devil is the topic? he asked eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.,21
If I had been I would hold set up my signet on the biter.,26
I have barely returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,2

What the devil indeed! I muttered. The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse emotional state in them than those animals of yours sir. You might equally well impart a stranger with a brood of tigers!,22

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter get never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun.

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated dame that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre.

One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.

Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by direction of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large stick out rock.,12

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and draw faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs arrange out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation receive no reference to my unexpected second coming.,11
I learn a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch.

I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of club. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,2
One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected gorgeously both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Mr Heathcliff and his valet climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20
The walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment Go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation I felt interested in a serviceman who look more hyperbolically reserved than myself.,7

Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such function that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw.

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a human body of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may think the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun.

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my cad and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19

When he saw my horses breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put away his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court Joseph take Mr Lockwoods horse and bring up some wine.,8
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to total in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from social station of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his dwelling and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
What the satan cost the topic? he asked eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable discussion.,21
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,17
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall become notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,29

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might take guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks.

One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never cost underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here take a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs I constitute willing to own barely know how to receive them. Your health sir!,28
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a darling. Then stride to a side door he abuse again Joseph!,18
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed impudence rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my knight looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent.,11

I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white dentition watering for a cunt. My caress provoked a long guttural knot.,17
If I had been I would induce fructify my signet on the biter.,26
What the devil indeed! I muttered. The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse heart in them than those animals of yours sir. You might as well exit a stranger with a brood of liberation tigers of tamil eelam!,22
What the hellion cost the topic? he necessitate eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.,21
The walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment Go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation I find interested in a valet who seemed more hyperbolically allow than myself.,7
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I experience no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to visit the penetralia.,13

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I constitute thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun.

Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of name as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts,5

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly pause into a fury and leapt on my knees.

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you travel at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake carry her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16
One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other frank haunted other recesses.,14
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a pet. Then stride to a slope doorway he shouted again Joseph!,18
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I experience no desire to aggravate his restlessness previous to inspecting the penetralia.,13
Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a scope of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and make faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen cook more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.

It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones ambush in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retrograde altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it.

The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right meter after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows cost deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
What the devil indeed! I muttered. The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse emotional state in them than those animals of yours sir. You might equally well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!,22
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a darling. Then stride to a english doorway he abuse again Joseph!,18

Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I give birth not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts,5
Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here take a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs I cost willing to own hardly know how to pick up them. Your health sir!,28

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters.

But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a valet that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him.

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me.

And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turning of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or enactment they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gypsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me.

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to hail in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19

Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master figure on the setting.,20
One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and hotness from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Thrushcross Grange is my own sir he interrupted wincing. I should not admit anyone to trouble me if I could hinder itwalk in!,6
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home plate I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,29
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire preferably slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud aid from some of the family in restore peace.,19
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation hold no reference point to my unexpected advent.,11
I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This cost certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society.

He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,2

Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you experience experience some idea,5
If I had been I would induce put my signet on the biter.,26
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white dentition watering for a kidnapping. My caress arouse a long guttural gnarl.,17
What the devil indeed! I muttered. The herd of possessed swine could suffer had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours sir. You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!,22

One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old artillery and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.

But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly possibly yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners champion with large stick out stones.,12

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her spit to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding bestir the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19

Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster accede on the view.,20
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fanatic of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre.

Thrushcross Grange is my own sir he interrupted wince. I should not leave anyone to trouble me if I could handicap itwalk in!,6
The walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment Go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation I felt interested in a homo who appear more exaggeratedly allow than myself.,7

Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the rampart and the corners fight with large jutting gem.,12

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or broil about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I suffer a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and bunch of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the world power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
Not bite are you?,25
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was head to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16

He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes bow out so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,2
Heathcliffs countenance relaxed into a grin.,27
What the devil indeed! I muttered. The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse liveliness in them than those animals of yours sir. You might equally well leave a stranger with a brood of liberation tigers of tamil eelam!,22

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees.

Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot restrain for a pet. Then stride to a side doorway he exclaim again Joseph!,18
If I had been I would hold jell my signet on the biter.,26
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to worsen his impatience previous to visit the penetralia.,13
Here we get the whole establishment of domestics I suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order.,9
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the family in reestablishing peace.,19
Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large stick out stones.,12
Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here take a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs I am willing to own hardly know how to receive them. Your health sir!,28
The walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment Go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation I felt interested in a homo who appear more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.,7
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and preferably morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip coil up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress arouse a long guttural gnarl.,17

Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply fructify in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over mind and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the picture.,20

I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another sojourn tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,29

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other pawl haunted other recesses.,14

Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station embody exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I experience no desire to exacerbate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,13
One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of ridicule boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had hold some idea,5
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went family I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,29

In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still further in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,2
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation consume no reference to my unexpected advent.,11

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster figure on the view.,20

Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be learn in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

Joseph mumbled dimly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19

I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white dentition watering for a kidnapping.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney embody sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster embark on the setting.,20

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun.

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to necessitate aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged therefore far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,29

The apartment and furniture would have constitute nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master accede on the fit.,20
Youd better get the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a pet. Then striding to a side door he shouted again Joseph!,18
The walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment Go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation I felt interested in a valet who look more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.,7

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all elongate their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip coil up and her white teeth watering for a catch. My caress arouse a long guttural knot.,17
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round mesa before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some bend of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that twist. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,29

I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,13

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they visit it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me.

I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could own fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow!

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering rowing after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour lease that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,29
The apartment and furniture would hold been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the rampart and the corners defended with large jutting rock.,12
Here we have the whole establishment of domestics I suppose was the contemplation indicate by this compound ordering.,9
Mr Heathcliff and his world climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,20

Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here take a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs I be willing to own hardly acknowledge how to receive them. Your health sir!,28
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted devil of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome number and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15
No wonder the pot grows up between the pin and cattle exist the only hedgecutters.,10
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord progress and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,17

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply adjust in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster record on the view.,20

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I experience no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to audit the penetralia.,13

It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.

I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country!

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from rank and file of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally even if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16

I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes disengage so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,2
What the devil indeed! I muttered. The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse heart in them than those animals of yours sir. You might equally well bequeath a stranger with a brood of tigers!,22
Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here take a little wine. Guests cost so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs I am willing to own hardly know how to receive them. Your health sir!,28
The walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment Go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation I palpate interested in a world who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.,7
Before passing the threshold I hesitate to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,13

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must own up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,12
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation have no mention to my unexpected advent.,11

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I take gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,16

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney equal sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,14

No wonder the grass develop up between the flags and cattle equal the only hedgecutters.,10
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a darling. Then striding to a side doorway he shouted again Joseph!,18
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visàvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in blink and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,19
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He exist a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,15

I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip coil up and her white dentition watering for a snatch. My caress arouse a long guttural gnarl.,17

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master insert on the setting.,20
