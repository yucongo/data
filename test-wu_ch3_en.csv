While leading the way upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never get anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.,2

A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of commute civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality,40

My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet now that they saw me refund and benumbed to my very heart I dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.,46
Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of enticement in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.,44
Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you constitute at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!,27
And you you worthlesshe broke out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The remainder of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?,42
With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me precipitate on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.,23

And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you want not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.,35
I obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a while of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. Come in! come in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.,37

How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so! she wrote. My head aches till I cannot preserve it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place,15

It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you did Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it.

Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I constitute condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.,20

Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I have enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.,39
In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea seat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.,5
All day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were dominate to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending What done already? On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!,7
Ill put my trash away because you can make me if I refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your natural language away except what I please!,43
Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was then extreme that he could barely nibble it up.,25
Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I accept got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.,12

Delightful company! mumble Heathcliff. Take the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly.

I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would cause of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.,17
Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent.

Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence I hastened to addThe truth is sir I exceed the first part of the night inHere I stopped afreshI was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge.

We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture embody said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion.

He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.,39

Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was thus extreme that he could barely peck it up.,25
While leading the way upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She practice not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.,2

Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a rip from his eyes.

Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and tug the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.,12
And you you worthlesshe broke out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and witness something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?,42

Mr Lockwood he added you may travel into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.,34
With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed gust aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.,23
All day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to lead our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake.

On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!,7

It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I have the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I agitate you.,26
Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the affectionateness of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.,44
It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for report her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41
You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you?

I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate.

I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the firm door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter.

I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I go steady a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.,17
All day had been flooding with rain we could not belong to church so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending What done already? On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!,7
Saying this he compelled us so to square our stead that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!,10
Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need excuse.,20
My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the earth many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind.

And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to receive sufficient company in himself.,35

I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took compassion and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!,33
Ill put my trash away because you can make me if I refuse answered the young lady closing her koran and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!,43

How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so! she wrote. My head aches till I cannot continue it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place,15
Heathcliff revoke his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay.

And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of search pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.,35
There was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompany this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and I drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.,38
Sir I exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety principal of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to departseventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninetyfirst is too much. Fellowmartyrs have at him! Drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more!,21
Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to yield me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.,12
We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been restrain whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.,19
This meter I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.,24
Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was then extreme that he could barely pick it up.,25
Maister Hindley! shouted our chaplain. Maister coom hither! Miss Cathys riven th back off Th Helmet uh Salvation un Heathcliffs pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh T Brooad Way to Destruction! Its fair flaysome ut yah let em goa on this gait. Ech! thorium owd world ud uh braid em properlybut hes goan!,11
Ill put my trash away because you can make me if I refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not perform anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!,43
While leading the way upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she suffice she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.,2
Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. take approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.,3
My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them embody quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart I dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.,46
You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you plump by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks,8
It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly sum up my garments. I should not care if you did Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!,28
Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I claim my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!,10
What can you mean by talking in this direction to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he struck his forehead with rage.,32
You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh son! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of.

With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to resurrect in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.,23
Sir I exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch I consume endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to departseventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninetyfirst is too much.

An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are die to rebelwe took our initiatory step this evening.,6
All day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy constitute commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending What done already? On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!,7
In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and stay spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.,5
In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the darkness as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin.

Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment.

I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it embody morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.,18
With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand equal against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.,23
Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a tear from his eyes. Mr Lockwood he added you may blend into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.,34
And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible serviceman ought to find sufficient company in himself.,35
If the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me! I render. Im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mothers side? And that minx Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or however she was calledshe must have been a changelingwicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions Ive no doubt!,30
And you you worthlesshe collapse out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash.

Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did I take advocate with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is come. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!,22
There was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and I absorb off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.,38

My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and natural depression in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.,45

Ill put my trash away because you can make me if I refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!,43
The ledge where I placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing however be nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.,4
I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his national I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.,17
It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She reserve her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41
It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I hold the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.,26
Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family accept a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.,3
A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the workbench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality,40

Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he determine it impossible to hold it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!,27
Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a buttocks far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.,44
This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must intercept it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.,24
And you you worthlesshe broke out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally exemplify by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?,42
I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I film pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!,33
With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows draw a bead on at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me.

Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.,38
Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence I hastened to addThe truth is sir I passed the first part of the night inHere I stopped afreshI exist about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge. A monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or,31
Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we constitute living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.,12
And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my invasion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.,35

We hail to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.,19
Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a tear from his eyes. Mr Lockwood he added you may go into my room youll only be in the way occur downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.,34
The ledge where I locate my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.,4
Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the kat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.,39
What do you mean? asked Heathcliff and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heavens sake! dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you cost having your throat cut!,29
An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my church father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are going to rebelwe took our initiatory step this evening.,6
A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts.

Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out last he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.,20

In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfume the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.,5

While leading the way upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she had only populate there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.,2

How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so! she wrote. My drumhead aches till I cannot keep it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place,15

Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the choker and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.,12
You forget you have a victor here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks,8
Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was therefore extreme that he could hardly peck it up.,25
And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to receive sufficient party in himself.,35
Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have cause. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.,20
Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I learn my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!,10

Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its natural elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.,39
My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of knoll the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.,45
With that concluding word the whole assembly inspire their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.,23
All day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to remove our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending What done already? On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!,7
Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy clock seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did I take counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is come. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!,22
A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress constitute allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality,40
While leading the direction upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.,2
It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for breed her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41
Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was then extreme that he could barely foot it up.,25

I obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led I stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He bring on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. Come in! come in! he sobbed. Cathy do come. Oh doonce more! Oh! my hearts darling! hear me this time Catherine at last! The spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.,37
Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut away near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.,3
The ledge where I placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing however was nothing but a name duplicate in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there change to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.,4

I practice not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!,33

He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41
There was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and I drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the rear kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.,38
Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the discourtesy I hastened to addThe truth is sir I passed the first part of the night inHere I stopped afreshI was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge.

I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would gain of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.,17
What do you mean? asked Heathcliff and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night since you constitute here but for heavens sake! dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut!,29

It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you did Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she desire to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up I assure you.

It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I hold the misfortune to yell in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I agitate you.,26

In the confluence of the multitude several clubs intersect blows aimed at me fell on other sconces.

If the little fiend induce got in at the window she probably would have strangled me! I returned. Im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mothers side? And that minx Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or however she was calledshe must have been a changelingwicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions Ive no doubt!,30

The ledge where I placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing however was nothing but a name recur in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.,4
This time I remembered I be lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.,24
Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill come in two hour!,36
And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. A sensible man ought to receive sufficient ship's company in himself.,35
I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I had set out on my way dwelling with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.,18
I did not know whether to resent this terminology or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!,33
And you you worthlesshe broke out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do gain their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?,42

I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. A pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.,12
Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the cad kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!,10

You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! equal that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks,8
Maister Hindley! shouted our chaplain. Maister coom hither! Miss Cathys riven th back off Th Helmet uh Salvation un Heathcliffs pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh T Brooad Way to Destruction! Its fair flaysome ut yah let em goa on this gait. Ech! th owd world ud uh spike em properlybut helium goan!,11
What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he struck his brow with fad.,32
All day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to assume our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending What done already? On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!,7
Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever hold done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.,20
You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances perpetrate his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of.

I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks,8
I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I hold no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!,33
I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence drive up another discipline she waxed lachrymose.,14
If the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me! I returned. Im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mothers side? And that minx Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or however she was calledshe must hold been a changelingwicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions Ive no doubt!,30

In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air pour with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.,5
Ill put my trash away because you can make me if I resist answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!,43
My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he dress for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when I imagined I was following correctly the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park saying I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then I pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles I believe I managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.,45
The ledge where I placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of fictional character large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.,4

I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in bed and fall asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.,17
T maister nobbut just buried and Sabbath nut oered und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr be laiking! Shame on ye! sit ye dahn ill childer! theys good script eneugh if cry learn em! sit ye dahn and intend uh yer sowls!,9
I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it exist morning and I had set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.,18

It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She agree her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41
Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly blame it up.,25
It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you perform Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!,28

Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I induce enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.,39

This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing strait and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.,24
Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst.

My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they hold completely given me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart I dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.,46
It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I own the misfortune to yell in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.,26
It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze.

He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41
A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he partake while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality,40

Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven cause I take counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is come. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!,22
Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where Joseph asseverated owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we embody living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter.

And you you worthlesshe fracture out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?,42
An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are travel to rebelwe took our initiatory step this evening.,6
It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you did Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to arrive another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up I assure you.

With that concluding word the whole assembly laud their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.,23
Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who be it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!,27
Saying this he compelled us then to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!,10
And for me too I replied. Ill walk in the yard till daylight and then Ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. Im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society exist it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.,35
Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and seat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.,20

Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a tear from his eyes. Mr Lockwood he added you may fail into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.,34
We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been observe whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.,19
Sir I exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to departseventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninetyfirst constitute too much. Fellowmartyrs have at him! Drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more!,21
It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you dress Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it.

She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41
Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did I lease counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is come. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!,22
Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. subscribe the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill come in two minutes!,36
I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would produce of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.,17
There was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and I attract off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.,38
It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I have the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.,26
Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill arrive in two minutes!,36
It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a frank now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41
A more elastic footstep entered next and now I unfold my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality,40
I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I claim pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!,33
How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so! she wrote. My head aches till I cannot keep it on the pillow and however I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place,15
An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley embody a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are going to rebelwe took our initiatory step this evening.,6
In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window and continued spelling over Catherine EarnshawHeathcliffLinton till my eyes closed but they give birth not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with Catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin. I snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it and took up another and another till I had examined all. Catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. At the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.,5
You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! be that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks,8
I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence accept up another discipline she waxed lachrymose.,14
This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I learn distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.,24
Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber drive upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!,10
It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I have the misfortune to shout in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.,26
What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he struck his brow with fury.,32
How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so! she wrote. My head aches till I cannot keep it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and I must not act together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place,15
While head the way upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.,2
I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I induce set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.,18
The ledge where I placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was shroud with writing scratched on the paint. This writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and smallCatherine Earnshaw here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and again to Catherine Linton.,4
I did not acknowledge whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it.

It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a koran by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41
Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff target his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.,44
It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I had the misfortune to yell in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I interrupt you.,26
Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passing. But away with you! Ill come in two minutes!,36
If the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me! I returned. Im not fail to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mothers side? And that minx Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or however she was calledshe must have been a changelingwicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions Ive no doubt!,30

There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their breadyou survive on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?,42
It was your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you did Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in exclude it up I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!,28
Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to bear it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!,27
It be your servant Zillah I replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. I should not care if you did Mr Heathcliff she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. Well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!,28
Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was thus extreme that he could barely foot it up.,25

I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!,33
Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and belong where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill come in two minutes!,36
What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he hit his brow with fad.,32
We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to suffice all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However in my dream Jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood God! what a sermon. divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.,19
Ill put my trash away because you can take me if I refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. But Ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what I please!,43
What can you mean by talking in this way to me? thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. Howhow dare you under my roof? God! hes mad to speak so! And he struck his forehead with rage.,32
Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy clock time seven did I take counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is come. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!,22

It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her handwriting interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also.

I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks,8
With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and I own no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.,23
This time I remembered I was lying in the oak water closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.,24
It is only your guest sir I called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I have the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I interrupt you.,26
Maister Hindley! shouted our chaplain. Maister coom hither! Miss Cathys riven th back off Th Helmet uh Salvation un Heathcliffs pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh T Brooad Way to Destruction!

My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that I perished last night and they were wondering how they must put about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart I dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat I am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment.,46
And you you worthlesshe broke out as I insert turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?,42
Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was indeed extreme that he could hardly nibble it up.,25
Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 hear all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden divine guidance descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.,20
I began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print I saw a red ornamented titleSeventy Times Seven and the First of the SeventyFirst. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject I sank back in bed and fell asleep. Alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that form me pass such a terrible night? I dont remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.,17
Oh God confound you Mr Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady. And who showed you up into this room? he continued beat his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. Who was it? Ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!,27
Always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as I fancied by the motion of his shadows arm dashing a tear from his eyes. Mr Lockwood he added you may function into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.,34
Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence I hastened to addThe truth is sir I excrete the first part of the night inHere I stopped afreshI was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge. A monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or,31
It is only your guest sir I address out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.,26
An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are become to rebelwe took our initiatory step this evening.,6
I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence contain up another subject she waxed lachrymose.,14
While leading the way upstairs she recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a randomness for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.,2

I asked the reason. She did not know she answered she had only survive there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.,2
Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was thus extreme that he could barely clean it up.,25
Saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop and lunge it into the dog kennel vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!,10
Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to equal entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities Heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets Mrs Heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.,44
I began to dream almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning and I experience set out on my way home with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that I could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from the textSeventy Times Seven and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed the First of the SeventyFirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.,18
You forget you have a master here says the tyrant. Ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh boy! was that you? Frances darling pull his hair as you go by I heard him snap his fingers. Frances pulled his hair heartily and then fail and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks,8
Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric jolt! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up.,25
How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so! she wrote. My head aches till I cannot keep it on the pillow and still I cant give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he pronounce he and I must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father how dared he? for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place,15
All day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so Joseph must needs contract up a congregation in the garret and while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their Bibles Ill answer for itHeathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that Joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending What done already? On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers!,7
It is only your guest sir I name out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. Im sorry I disturbed you.,26

The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could barely pluck it up.,25
There was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and I disembowel off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.,38
I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that I contract pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as I spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict I continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night Not three oclock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight!,33
An awful Sunday! commenced the paragraph beneath. I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrociousH. and I are going to rebelwe took our initiatory step this evening.,6
Too stupefied to be curious myself I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having border on this structure I looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff and everyone else.,3
Delightful company! muttered Heathcliff. Take the candle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the houseJuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! Ill issue forth in two minutes!,36
And you you worthlesshe broke out as I entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. There you are at your idle tricks again! The rest of them act earn their breadyou live on my charity! Put your trash away and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade?,42
barely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliffs with Catherines name in the bookwhich had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened.

I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.,38
Two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these I stretched myself and Grimalkin ride the other. We were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.,39
If the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me! I returned. Im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mothers side? And that minx Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or however she embody calledshe must have been a changelingwicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions Ive no doubt!,30

With that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves race round me in a body and I having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with Joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counterrappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and Branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabess part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.,23

A more elastic footstep entered next and now I opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for Hareton Earnshaw exist performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. He noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality,40
Oh how weary I grew. How I writhed and yawned and nodded and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. I was condemned 10 learn all out finally he reached the First of the SeventyFirst. At that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.,20
Heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat I stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute.

Thou art the Man! cries Jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did I carry counsel with my soulLo this is human weakness this also may be absolved! The First of the SeventyFirst is come. Brethren execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!,22
T maister nobbut just buried and Sabbath nut oered und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr equal laiking! Shame on ye! sit ye dahn ill childer! theys good books eneugh if yell read em! sit ye dahn and think uh yer sowls!,9
It opened into the house where the females were already astir Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and Mrs Heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for shroud her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.,41

This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet and I heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow I heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that I resolved tosilence it if possible and I thought I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook be soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. I must stop it nevertheless! I muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed Let me inlet me in! Who are you? I asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. Catherine Linton it replied shiveringly why did I think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton Im come home Id lost my way on the moor! As it spoke I discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed Let me in! and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear. How can I? I said at length. Let me go if you want me to let you in! The fingers relaxed I snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant I listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on! Begone! I shouted Ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years. It is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. Ive been a waif for twenty years! Thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion I discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself. At last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer Is any one here? I considered it best to confess my presence for I knew Heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.,24

Heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock! the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation be so extreme that he could hardly pick it up.,25
