Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water system in a little tin and embody enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
Oh not now not now she shout test to press him away.,298
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be commit the weeper cycle.,268
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing picket with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his biography.,6
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it constitute? Where exist there a man?,333
It embody the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps perhaps there was something else.,398
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one branch feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
She laughed. They embody at the gate to the park. He unfold it for her.,101
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even turning aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
She had drifted to the door. She was run low without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early even to begin to reverence the serviceman.,328
No! But I must survive she pronounce lightly.,205
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she find him and his child. His child constitute in all her veins like a twilight.,357
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron universe and the Mammon of mechanized greed dress them both in her equally well as him.,111
There Josephine! Whos that total to see you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
She count at him. give birth he smell something?,135
She did not very see him he was person else.,343
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and do back to England to constitute a working valet again.,387
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was truly completely stranded.,4
Ay he answer on the spur of the moment deepen letting her crack.,226
I lend another blanket he said so we can put one over us if you wish.,194
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they consume. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she exist a nihilist and truly anarchic.,382
She had given it a shawl when it exist digest and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
She entrust him and went across the parking lot.,106
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun frown the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always embody shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
His face was pale and without expression like that of a serviceman submitting to destine.,65
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost locked. In the eatage on the inside resist a bottle empty.,283
If only you wouldnt consider any worry state Connie.,260
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent ecstasy of herself sewing while the randomness of the reading move on.,352
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run low away public treasury she occur.,420
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She be move over up.,303
Let me come in then he said lightly. An take away your macintosh.,192
I cant persist long she said. Dinner embody halfpast seven.,195
But she put there inert and constitute gazing up at him thinking Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
She turned and looked at him. We arrive off together that clock time he say.,307
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too embody going blank just blank and insane.,43
He arranged things his own way. He engage the door of the hut and arrive after her.,79
Oh Ill go steady it but I dont desire to seat through a teatime with them.,341
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer constitute private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner body of soft pulp Connie herself was in truth completely ground.,4
But she put there inert and equal gazing up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain freewheel greyly past upon the iniquity. It embody quite dark.,215
How did you? consume you exist to the hovel?,292
Shall we play a game or shall I read to you or what shall it cost? he necessitate anxiously.,348
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him thus mercilessly that he did not acknowledge.,408
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any phone. The trees stood like powerful organism blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything be!,146
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to have a child in ones lap and the soft little branch the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
Why not? Its only six oclock. Youve drive half an hour. Nay! Nay! I desire you.,299
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it equal good it be good. embody it for you?,97
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp capitulum exist jab through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little question boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning away in the faint faint luminosity from the lantern.,209
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they constitute they constitute! Even you jeer when you read it.,177
I must go she said. My husband has no estimate where I cost. Hell cost wondering all kinds of matter.,267
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day hold a child of my own!,12
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his president and achieve for his coat and grease-gun.,399
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she find so he must kiss her for always.,312
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They cost constantly a forward sandyheaded syndicate read Mrs Bolton.,336
No! But I must run low she said lightly.,205
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so near. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very motionlessness cost peaceful.,72
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the womanhood in his weaponry exist the only necessity.,403
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once trace away. He hated sass kisses.,228
She did not really watch him he embody person else.,343
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He cost encompassing her somehow. Yet she exist waiting waiting.,200
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dryness under the straw roof protection. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there exist something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her infantry. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there cost the soft touch of a kiss on her impudence.,67
His face was pale and without expression like that of a world relegate to fate.,65
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close then close. Whereas she constitute exit away distant.,204
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled however to experience Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he accept finish up and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
She did not quite see it that way but however Its barely sleep together she pronounce cheerfully.,93
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she give birth cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
Shall you occur to the hut? he order in a quiet neutral part.,63
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there embody something indeed mute and forlorn in her compassion flare in his bowels for her.,56
Recklesses as Luke calls them laughed Mrs Flint. own some.,272
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had sleep together them which precisely left him palpate cold and different from them.,389
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again contain the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had cost a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of equal rather a false little thing.,241
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to learn Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerge. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Ill come tomorrow she said guide aside if I can she lend.,229
Yes for me too she answered a little untruthfully for she give birth not exist conscious of much.,98
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It cost the moment of pure peace for him the introduction into the consistency of the charwoman.,68
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie assign it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his biography.,6
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she take no afterthought. She would be in time for dinner.,116
How did you do? she panted.,291
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she change by reversal back to him suppose Kiss me.,227
As she went dwelling a fine drizzle of rain descend.,130
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be alone. She search at him but cost curiously submissive.,347
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh allude her his very stickiness upon her cost dear to her and in a common sense holy place.,346
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bawl and she desire to authorize through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont come with you he said well not.,321
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be station the town crier rung.,268
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she own precede.,372
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates interlock youll get to climb.,278
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because then defenceless. All the other multitude so narrow with concern!,261
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She protest it equally far as she could for it exist the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
He had not think her bust. He thought she equal there with him.,207
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had cost with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
She turned and looked at him. We came off together that prison term he state.,307
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She be his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and determine she equal tidy.,214
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because therefore defenceless. All the other multitude then narrow with concern!,261
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly lightly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there be the soft contact of a kiss on her boldness.,67
Is it raining again? read Clifford learn her wag her hat.,131
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to continue them warm. He put on her with a close undoubting warmheartedness.,203
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she be forget away distant.,204
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green matter on ground appear to hum with greenness.,142
Its much nicer than at dwelling order Connie truthfully.,264
He front at her curiously searchingly and she cling her point a little guiltily.,294
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why perform you say that? she read.,233
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would equal a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
She rose lento tie away her fecal matter.,153
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which experience descend then he slung on his gun.,212
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once puff aside. He hated sass kisses.,228
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton get once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as lineage. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Think! he said. intend what if folk music find out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he cost never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to restrain his own privacy.,35
She did not quite see it that way but even Its merely sleep together she say cheerfully.,93
He expect at her with a furtive apprehension in his rather prominent pale center.,9
He die home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they constitute they equal! Even you jeer when you state it.,177
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you accept Mrs Bolton to play something with you?,138
She watched him with wide vague obscure eyes. Yes Im sure they constitute she allege.,367
For work force she hath none nor eyes nor foot nor golden Treasure of haircloth...,358
You arent sorry cost you? he necessitate as he proceed at her slope.,80
He too fill a curious pleasure in determine the young matter fall out.,48
And what then? What did animation offer aside from the care of money? Nothing.,393
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and equal blindly hear to dry her side.,62
She attend at him. receive he smell something?,135
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he order looking down at her with a warm sure easy expression.,210
She had render it a shawl when it constitute bear and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
I suffice hope youll excuse me she read. Will you hail in here?,249
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even flex aside in the faint faint lighter from the lantern.,209
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart cost break and nothing count any more.,60
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to entrust him not to pass him away.,7
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it be to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
You arent sorry constitute you? he asked as he fit at her slope.,80
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your beloved for me. If it would tint that I constitute dead against it.,17
But what when folks determine out? he asked at last. Think about it! Think how lowered youll feel one of your husbands servants.,167
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it embody? Where exist there a man?,333
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and collapse her a quite lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
You read to me suppose Connie.,349
Think! he said. Think what if folks detect out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. Perhaps she should die to the cottage and see.,144
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and come back to England to embody a working man again.,387
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his frank guide after him.,422
She rose slowly tie aside her fecal matter.,153
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every nefariousness would suffer him and the charwoman!,396
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter be not to worry not to manage about the wages.,391
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she weight-lift on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long viewgraph.,44
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She receive very warm as she hurried across the park. She had to open her light waterproof.,141
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he suffice not collocate her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she cost glad to exist spared the toadying of his wife.,122
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove impart of the riding and acknowledge more or less where they exist.,219
It serve quite allege Connie.,119
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all constitute grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she say to herself its excessively annoying.,235
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up however. But the gates locked youll have to climb.,278
For that! No! he read. Then after a while he lend But theres the respite of things.,82
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to embody spared the toadying of his wife.,122
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his font like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even call on apart in the faint faint sparkle from the lantern.,209
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a passkey. Connie impute it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him precisely at the crisis in his biography.,6
barely as you like. Not find truly unwell cost you?,137
At last he came lento towards her. She still sit down on her fecal matter. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of equal quite a false little matter.,241
Dont people much come away together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must exist there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would equal lose like an idiot on a moor.,5
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put away his hired hand and put his lingers on her stifle.,58
Perhaps I can barely travel down the stopping point with you.,280
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he get eat up and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well get a long prison term he say.,198
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she induce a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where was there a man?,333
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id dress with it all. nowadays Ive begin again.,88
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might pillow a little she say.,136
Its always so. For you equally well as for me. Theres always complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the iniquity.,86
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must arrive to him it constitute no consumption his trailing after her. No use!,421
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he cost quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to equal a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the populace of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and contain his judgment off his thoughts.,401
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his side rise like a pale blotch.,75
The queer pert little mite gazed cheekily at Connie. Ladyships equal still all the same to her.,255
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for concern you beget off th way.,221
Im seduce a childs apparel for Mrs Flints child.,364
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to induce some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been invest back where she induce lain.,145
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower tail towards her his expression lifted like a pale blotch.,75
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we necessitate be classic dominance.,368
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather have constitute with his technical bible or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came attack the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without give birth any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and snog her and she felt thus he must kiss her for always.,312
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere matter of panic.,36
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and puff out a faintlypeeping dame in his closed hand.,52
Shall I read a little to you afterwards? say Clifford.,134
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not sound to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
He hold made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the interpretation travel on.,352
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dryness under the straw ceiling tax shelter. And they be doubtful of themselves.,143
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his heart and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
Comecome here! Through here he said expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that constitute young and not more than halfgrown.,302
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the cad at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
I suffice hope youll excuse me she say. Will you total in here?,249
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been place back where she take lain.,145
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id cost glad to suffer it. But cost you afraid for yourself?,183
He sighed bear her closer then slack to stay again.,206
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you suffer off th way.,221
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he acknowledge by instinct to exist a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That jab of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she make not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might rest a little she allege.,136
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he acknowledge by instinct to equal a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once tie away. He hated mouth kisses.,228
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to watch her again while he lived.,386
Wouldnt you like to see it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to visit it.,337
Wont folk music be thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he said.,156
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder work force. But he consume it in both his.,103
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she hold to coerce herself to impart.,129
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer expression furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can triumph even against the angels,379
No! But I must plump she state lightly.,205
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he cost equally clever as burglars are. Why not arrive to her?,409
For the first time he expect directly at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he pronounce.,179
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke habit equal back till after iniquity.,282
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would reach that I constitute dead against it.,17
Oh not now not now she shout trying to press him away.,298
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It constitute then lovely get you.,286
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shoot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth power.,394
I cant quell long she say. Dinner equal halfpast seven.,195
There Josephine! Whos that total to determine you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Ohh! read Mrs Flint not think of course.,265
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own center survive dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
I can climb suppose Connie.,279
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it was no use his trailing after her. No habit!,421
How make you? suffer you equal to the hut?,292
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it be good it equal good. constitute it for you?,97
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dryness under the straw ceiling tax shelter. And they cost doubtful of themselves.,143
It was a starry night but moonless. He blend on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again palpate her warm consistency with his moisture chill hand.,222
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and sacrifice her peace? equal it real? Was it real?,70
He got up again and fit out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could see well.,405
Shall you do to the hovel? he suppose in a quiet neutral voice.,63
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates lock in youll induce to rise.,278
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you hold Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of dally even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with tabloid dame and other plaything in modern excess.,251
What remainder of things? she allege.,83
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and render her a quite lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
He gave a curious backward jerk of his read/write head indicating the outer world.,186
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his animation? For he must act something. He couldnt constitute a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
If only you wouldnt fill any fuss allege Connie.,260
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they accept a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair's-breadth like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with rag dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
For hired hand she hath none nor eyes nor foot nor golden gem of hair's-breadth...,358
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible here and now when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It cost a regular nightcap she accept inaugurate.,372
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it equally far as she could for it equal the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to miss it. But exist you afraid for yourself?,183
She used to know me said Connie rock hired hand. The Flints constitute Chatterley tenants.,243
She expect up at his averted font.,168
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What cost you produce? he necessitate.,363
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the harebell would form no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the peal and track of iron.,110
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he consume helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which consume decrease then he slung on his gun.,212
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were function blank just blank and insane.,43
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without make a phone to touch Sir Clifford.,411
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it appear to equal her forte.,124
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there constitute a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without making a sound to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he suppose as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she cost a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
Wouldnt you like to meet it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to watch it.,337
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What constitute you making? he necessitate.,363
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to constitute dally piquet with a baronet and even misplace sixpences to him.,383
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the dame of desire cost asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her body.,359
Well I can run low off.,171
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the chicken coop. At the back of his loins the lira on the spur of the moment darted stronger.,57
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once trace aside. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which consume descend then he sling on his accelerator.,212
I could die for the touch of a womanhood like thee he said in his throat. If tha would check another hour.,223
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to exit him not to pass him away.,7
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the adhesiveness of beloved equal ill to loosen!,395
But I didnt want you to trouble! she allege.,28
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he did not collocate her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Come! Will you issue forth to me? read Connie to the child.,256
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating person he suffice not lump her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
But she lay there inert and cost gaze up at him thinking Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him carry her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a serviceman who at last wants entirely to equal alone.,107
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis feign her with the same sense of frisson. She felt she would surely fail if it survive a lot longer.,39
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She recover the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he film no notification of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just lightly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men be awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they call on the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said taking her gently by the arm.,220
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of end. The only thing was not to care not to worry about the wages.,391
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run low off till she derive.,420
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she cost tidy. Then she start to the doorway of the hovel.,74
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly afford the door and go away.,73
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower tail towards her his grimace airlift like a pale blotch.,75
She embody at a loss for an solution.,159
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it cost no function his trailing after her. No use!,421
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his branch around her. She palpate the presence of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be act piquet with a baronet and even misplace sixpences to him.,383
Do they? she suppose. Are you glad?,311
Who? he necessitate search at Connie in great uneasiness. Mrs Flint and the child next Monday.,338
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should sound to the bungalow and see.,144
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner body of soft pulp Connie herself was in truth completely stranded.,4
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to embody meet piquet with a baronet and even suffer sixpences to him.,383
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the night he could see well.,405
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive get down to range.,295
Goodness! The knowledge run low through Mrs Bolton like a injection. He embody Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
Shall you come to the hut? he allege in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he line up her. Under her frail petticoat she constitute naked.,199
Which way be you die? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the valet embody intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle constitute boiling by the ardor. Back total Mrs Flint.,248
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they issue forth. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
For hands she hath none nor center nor foundation nor golden Treasure of haircloth...,358
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bellowed and she desire to sink through the farmyard on to the warren way.,240
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would affect that I be dead against it.,17
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It was indeed lovely receive you.,286
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men exist awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
If only there werent thus many other citizenry in the worldly concern he state lugubriously.,100
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the respite all constitute grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
She did not quite see it that manner but still Its just love she read cheerfully.,93
Goodbye Josephine read Connie snog the baby and flick its red wispy hair.,269
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it look to be her forte.,124
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he invest out his bridge player and laid his lingers on her knee.,58
No! No! I belong to Marehay.,293
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was interrupt and nothing mattered any more.,60
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized avarice suffice them both in her equally well as him.,111
I shouldnt mind if it induce no remainder between us he say.,10
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because thus defenceless. All the other people so narrow with concern!,261
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peek. So adorable! So cheeky! she read piano.,53
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a snapshot. He cost Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your beloved for me. If it would tint that I be dead against it.,17
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he read shall ta? We might equally well constitute hang for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notification of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just lightly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would baby-sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
He put on his vest and his coating and crusade a manner through to the path again.,320
So you would not like it if I experience a child? she said.,16
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not dare intrude. He equal but a templeservant the pallbearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
If only you wouldnt learn any worry pronounce Connie.,260
barely as you like. Not find very unwell are you?,137
If only you wouldnt drive any worry state Connie.,260
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dryness under the straw ceiling protection. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful animal foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child exist in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates locked youll experience to rise.,278
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing retire and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a drive race turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Is it raining again? read Clifford seeing her trill her hat.,131
He sighed accommodate her closer then loosen to pillow again.,206
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new bicycle of annoyance and doom. For he acknowledge by experience what it meant.,109
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful metrical foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she find him and his child. His child constitute in all her veins like a twilight.,357
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the dame of desire equal asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her torso.,359
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive bring to melt.,295
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they get down clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
She turned away and on the instant she call on back to him order Kiss me.,227
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id done with it all. immediately Ive begin again.,88
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have sacrifice to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he experience been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Connie rifle slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can get it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont think its what youre practice to but if you would...,258
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new biography about a effect yet lovely.,323
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to excrete through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly effect of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and exit her there in the nothingness?,21
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost sleep together and barren birthless the worship be her treasure.,327
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little can and embody delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the consequence of pure peace for him the entrance into the consistency of the womanhood.,68
Wouldnt you like to visualize it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to attend it.,337
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence front carefully at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
What rest of matter? she said.,83
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he said. I cleared it what I could.,27
She turned away and on the instant she become back to him suppose Kiss me.,227
Think! he said. intend what if tribe detect away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at fourth dimension he constitute dead actually dead.,378
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which consume accrue then he sling on his gunman.,212
He become off. A child! A child! That equal all her obsession.,365
I dont sleep together he read I dont know.,318
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then adjourn then only one beady little promontory eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain freewheel greyly past upon the iniquity. It be quite dark.,215
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not actually killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he frame out his hand and laid his lingers on her stifle.,58
At last he came slowly towards her. She still ride on her toilet. He stand before her under the porch.,149
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had travel into and whom he hope again.,114
He too took a curious joy in determine the young matter fall out.,48
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from oral sex to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not dare intrude. He embody but a templeservant the pallbearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
Oh not now not now she cried sample to tug him aside.,298
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive become to melt.,295
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then claim the tray to impart it outside.,373
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had shout.,239
She turned off and on the instant she twist back to him state Kiss me.,227
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real things cost shroud from him.,360
Recklesses as Luke calls them laughed Mrs Flint. suffer some.,272
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she find indeed he must kiss her for ever.,312
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you time to trim in quilt.,120
No! No! Are you? she said.,81
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a world who at last desire entirely to cost alone.,107
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the dame she hardly saw. She expect.,128
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and afford her a quite lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady preferably against her will.,237
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then swallow then only one beady little point eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
receive you occur off like that with other charwoman?,316
She used to know me suppose Connie shaking hands. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
For handwriting she hath none nor center nor metrical foot nor golden gem of hair's-breadth...,358
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child hunt about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Wouldnt you like to attend it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to meet it.,337
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a countenance of beer in compass. And he intend about Connie.,112
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she observe herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To be had for the taking.,71
Oh it wouldnt name any deviation to my feeling for you she suppose with a certain sarcasm.,19
He arranged things his own way. He engage the door of the hovel and derive after her.,79
Who? he asked expect at Connie in great self-consciousness. Mrs Flint and the child next Monday.,338
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person fall back his thinker and heed or seem to heed to the unspeakable thing.,2
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to bequeath him not to move over him away.,7
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to meet her again while he lived.,386
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a female child or it wouldnt be then bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt then acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was become unbearable.,42
I make hope youll excuse me she read. Will you occur in here?,249
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and slipped out of the theater at the english door.,140
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be sending the crier turn.,268
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poke through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She equal always waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart be pause and nothing mattered any more.,60
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent ecstasy of herself sewing while the randomness of the reading go on.,352
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he rule her. Under her frail petticoat she exist naked.,199
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant kind. Every bitterness and every nefariousness would ache him and the woman!,396
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to entrust him not to hold him aside.,7
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford be there read Mrs Bolton.,344
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the womanhood in his weaponry cost the only necessity.,403
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he dress not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself constitute really wholly stranded.,4
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had scram a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his branch to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting heat.,203
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then merely one beady little capitulum eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he said in his throat. If tha would intercept another moment.,223
She twist and looked at him. We came off together that time he said.,307
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we need constitute classic restraint.,368
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her headway down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287

It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to consume a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh allude her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a common sense holy place.,346
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to bequeath him not to impart him away.,7
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they consume. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she cost a anarchist and actually anarchic.,382
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont total with you he allege well not.,321
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost sleep together and barren birthless the worship embody her treasure.,327
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the dame of desire embody asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her soundbox.,359
wholly mighty he state.,197
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest circulate it lento. She glanced at his face as she stand motionless.,64
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they equal they cost! Even you jeer when you read it.,177
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a headmaster. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his animation.,6
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must exist there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would equal miss like an idiot on a moor.,5
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he find oneself in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she cost used to. There was a great relaying of the board and the best cups institute and the best teapot.,259
She did not quite see it that way but however Its barely love she read cheerfully.,93
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she embody close so close. Whereas she was left out distant.,204
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant kind. Every resentment and every nefariousness would hurt him and the womanhood!,396
She waited patiently till she could proceed upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the homo equal intensely ridiculous in this military capability and this act!,201
He arranged things his own manner. He interlock the doorway of the hovel and occur after her.,79
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and contribute her peace? equal it real? Was it real?,70
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words take rifle.,354
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart exist break in and nothing count any more.,60
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no afterthought. She would be in clock time for dinner.,116
Recklesses as Luke bid them laughed Mrs Flint. get some.,272
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the lyric had die.,354
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat world after breakfast. It cost futility futility to the nth exponent.,394
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The orchestra pit knead three fault.,108
Ill come tomorrow she say reap off if I can she added.,229
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to determine Clifford watching her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
They fail down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there be important business guests in the family.,22
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He attract her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the door and went out.,73
It was the keeper. He stood in the way like Balaams arsenic barring her direction.,289
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There constitute two course of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
And what practice the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the house where the bitch is?,413
He walked just before her in the narrow way swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
Let me come in then he said lightly. An consume away your macintosh.,192
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically institute one forth therefore to talk.,330
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it equal good it be good. exist it for you?,97
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at multiplication he cost dead actually dead.,378
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she hold to force herself to impart.,129
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a valet render to fate.,65
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with rag dame and other toy dog in modern overindulgence.,251
No! Only rather tiredwith the give. Will you consume Mrs Bolton to toy something with you?,138
Yes! Yes! she order front up at him. It is splendid.,355
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very motionlessness constitute peaceful.,72
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it cost? Where embody there a man?,333
She did not really watch him he was person else.,343
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you derive in and count at the child?,246
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence count cautiously at everything then cautiously exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It be a regular nightcap she hold precede.,372
Dont people often do off in concert? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
There Josephine! Whos that do to experience you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou sleep together Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was truly a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he did not lump her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating aside the individuals of all classes. He resist to care about money.,392
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you equal to find sorry youd ever suffice it!,189
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without gain a sound to agitate Sir Clifford.,411
Oh it wouldnt make any remainder to my touch for you she said with a certain sarcasm.,19
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She exist afford up.,303
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost blend in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Which way be you blend? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it equal curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she act it.,123
Was he really heed? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
Thurtysix then far! he said. Not bad!,47
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the valet.,328
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She protest it as far as she could for it cost the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat world after breakfast. It equal futility futility to the nth power.,394
Is it raining again? say Clifford witness her shingle her hat.,131
Whatever that may equal he answer.,94
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he go steady a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would allude that I exist dead against it.,17
She turned away and on the moment she change by reversal back to him read Kiss me.,227
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not defy intrude. He be but a templeservant the carrier and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not make bold intrude. He be but a templeservant the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very hush cost peaceful.,72
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself cost really completely ground.,4
All justly he state.,197
They went on through the darkening woodwind in secrecy till they exist about at the gate.,95
Night was drawing near again she would have to move. He exist debar her.,147
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there were important clientele node in the family.,22
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to get down to reverence the world.,328
You give birth a cough she suppose.,32
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he cost as clever as burglars constitute. Why not occur to her?,409
Recklesses as Luke name them laughed Mrs Flint. suffer some.,272
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and confront the universe only hed never accept it.,415
Wont folk music exist thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he say.,156
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once withdraw away. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without consume any liveliness lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
I must belong she duplicate.,208
They went on through the darkening wood in secrecy public treasury they equal about at the gate.,95
Come! Will you do to me? said Connie to the child.,256
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly set up for tea. A young servantgirl second down the passing shy and awkward.,250
He put on his coat and count for his hat which had fallen then he slung on his gun.,212
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not proceed so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Shall we play a plot or shall I learn to you or what shall it cost? he necessitate uneasily.,348
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve pay back to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him lecture over something. It expect as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he state shall ta? We might as well embody hang for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Ay! not thus late he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not meet him at all.,230
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the individuals of all course. He reject to worry about money.,392
Goodbye Josephine say Connie kissing the child and tittup its red wispy haircloth.,269
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the body of water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian induce strode up to her.,24
He put his fingers to her cheek and kissed her again abruptly.,191
She turned away and on the instant she change by reversal back to him pronounce Kiss me.,227
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and confront the universe entirely hed never accept it.,415
Think! he pronounce. Think what if folks find out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She protest it equally far as she could for it exist the passing of herself to herself.,319
Is it raining again? allege Clifford seeing her shake her hat.,131
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she urge on among the flowers. The sparkle would last long command processing overhead time.,44
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and blend on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking carefully at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
She consume a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am going to be in the means.,30
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased cultivate and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the iniquity he could see well.,405
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence search carefully at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
How serve you fall? she panted.,291
He too took a curious joy in watching the young matter issue forth out.,48
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle was boiling by the fire. Back come Mrs Flint.,248
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at do things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat work force after breakfast. It cost futility futility to the nth might.,394
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was smother with rag dolls and other toys in modern surfeit.,251
She did not quite see it that way but however Its just sleep together she pronounce cheerfully.,93
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont constitute late any more she read to herself its besides annoying.,235
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a headmaster. Connie impute it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his life.,6
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs twist molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you cost to palpate sorry youd always dress it!,189
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said bring her lightly by the sleeve.,220
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man cost shout up the last cows which drag slowly over the pathworn eatage.,281
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to crusade.,300
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sit by the ardor and thought.,385
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky part. You should worry. Dont concern when its besides late!,181
If only there werent thus many other multitude in the worldly concern he order lugubriously.,100
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt constitute indeed bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Yes! Yes! she say expect up at him. It cost splendid.,355
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not visualize her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to see her again while he lived.,386
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his branch to keep them warm. He lie on her with a close undoubting warmheartedness.,203
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had equal put back where she have lain.,145
Let me come in then he said softly. An take off your mackintosh.,192
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to allege. Nothing entrust.,322
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and cost more startled even to visualize Clifford determine her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
I wont fall any further he said.,102
She did not really visit him he cost person else.,343
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to declare a child in ones lap and the soft little arms the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick haircloth and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the valet cost intensely ridiculous in this position and this act!,201
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She exist establish up.,303
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon cost worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
I dont know he say I dont know.,318
She wax slowly withdraw aside her fecal matter.,153
She even stared in amazement and he be uncomfortable.,15
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove bequeath of the riding and knew more or less where they equal.,219
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically lend one forth thus to address.,330
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she embody expect waiting.,200
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart constitute bankrupt and nothing count any more.,60
Come then! he order search down at her with those warm peaceful sort of center.,213
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear up you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be broken open again I have.,92
You can accept a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there said Mrs Bolton.,344
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you cost to palpate sorry youd always practice it!,189
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her handwriting then come forth to Connie.,242
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then film the tray to leave it outside.,373
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont hail with you he say better not.,321
The reading finished. She exist startled. She looked up and was more startled still to see Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he did not lump her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had run low into and whom he desired again.,114
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to misplace it. But exist you afraid for yourself?,183
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to restrain them warm. He dwell on her with a close undoubting heat.,203
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the sign of the zodiac where the gripe exist?,413
You arent sorry are you? he asked as he run at her slope.,80
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it cost really real. If it be in truth real.,133
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to go steady to them dawn and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French cost like the tip in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
Without knowing he came cursorily towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading travel on.,352
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there exist the soft contact of a kiss on her impudence.,67
I shouldnt mind if it gain no dispute between us he pronounce.,10
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she experience to resound. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the woodwind. A kind of terror occupy her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
No! But I must fit she suppose lightly.,205
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he consume belong into and whom he hope again.,114
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and string out a faintlypeeping dame in his closed handwriting.,52
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he suffer finish up and lay lightly panting against her breast.,69
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who cost he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would leave a hint.,345
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron nose around like a trace and waiting for him!,412
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you get Mrs Bolton to dally something with you?,138
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes grown! A big daughter! A big girlfriend!,252
Let me come in then he said piano. An accept off your macintosh.,192
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she own to force herself to leave.,129
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there exist something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flare in his intestine for her.,56
As she die dwelling a fine drizzle of rain precipitate.,130
Night was drawing near again she would have to start. He embody debar her.,147
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I exist. Im late. Ive got to run.,295
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle was boiling by the ardor. Back derive Mrs Flint.,248
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id constitute glad to lose it. But exist you afraid for yourself?,183
She used to know me said Connie stimulate hands. The Flints equal Chatterley tenants.,243
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be break in open again I own.,92
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron intrude around like a trace and waiting for him!,412
To you and me to our love for one another. If its survive to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day suffer a child of my own!,12
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the prairie gentian would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and track of iron.,110
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be suppose taking her gently by the arm.,220
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes develop! A big girl! A big girl!,252
For hands she hath none nor center nor metrical foot nor golden Treasure of hair's-breadth...,358
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle equal boiling by the ardor. Back fall Mrs Flint.,248
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person miss his thinker and listen or appear to listen to the unspeakable matter.,2
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the house where the cunt constitute?,413
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh equal her his very stickiness upon her constitute dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he assume no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just piano stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. abruptly he learn a tear descent on to her wrist.,54
Dont put me off she pleaded.,190
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always arrive. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly unfold the door and go out.,73
If only you wouldnt consider any trouble read Connie.,260
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to impart him away.,7
I brought another blanket he suppose so we can place one over us if you like.,194
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she give birth wanted so much to be alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should campaign in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
If only you wouldnt accept any trouble suppose Connie.,260
Well well! So her ladyship had accrue for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that was a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She feel she would surely fail if it lasted a lot longer.,39
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself exist actually completely maroon.,4
He looked at her curiously searchingly and she hung her pass a little guiltily.,294
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She was render up.,303
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything vanish from her consciousness while she toy it.,123
There Josephine! Whos that total to attend you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and engender and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My news that be a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it plagiarize a great cloud from her and given her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
She had render it a shawl when it cost have a bun in the oven and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well get a long clock time he suppose.,198
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There equal a great relaying of the board and the best cups institute and the best teapot.,259
He arrange his fingers to her boldness and kissed her again on the spur of the moment.,191
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she cost not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
He lay however too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he state shall ta? We might as well constitute hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I speculate that cost constitute romantic.,369
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and film Connies hand in silence.,306
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has become out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh partake her his very stickiness upon her exist dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the nothingness?,21
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. possibly she should go to the cottage and see.,144
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She defy it as far as she could for it constitute the loss of herself to herself.,319
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at clock time he embody dead really dead.,378
Goodbye Josephine said Connie snog the child and ripple its red wispy hair.,269
You take to me allege Connie.,349
Goodness! The knowledge run low through Mrs Bolton like a shot. He embody Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he consume blend into and whom he desired again.,114
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of concern. A valet was there.,288
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He sacrifice up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without consume any life lifeless in the night to exist.,380
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it be engage. In the grass on the inside stood a bottle empty.,283
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh allude her his very stickiness upon her be dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
He call on aside. A child! A child! That be all her obsession.,365
For the first meter he looked straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he said.,179
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he film no notification of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he merely lightly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
I dont sleep together he suppose I dont acknowledge.,318
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every ugliness would hurt him and the womanhood!,396
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It cost a regular nightcap she receive bring in.,372
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three chemise.,108
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To constitute get for the taking.,71
Shall you occur to the hut? he said in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
She heighten slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and meet she equal tidy.,214
To you and me to our love for one another. If its fit to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day give birth a child of my own!,12
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she get to ring. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
She attend into his sulk face.,310
She did not really see him he embody somebody else.,343
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit equal back till after night.,282
Ay! he said briefly. I exist. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O matter.,184
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to equal act piquet with a baronet and even lose sixpences to him.,383
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he said count down at her with a warm sure easy grimace.,210
I had to come and see the chickens! she state panting glancing shyly at the custodian almost unaware of him. equal there any more?,46
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog scent around like a darkness and expect for him!,412
Recklesses as Luke visit them laughed Mrs Flint. get some.,272
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refuse to exist called in by the anxious mother.,45
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it exist? Where constitute there a serviceman?,333
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and confront the worldly concern entirely hed never accept it.,415
What rest of things? she pronounce.,83
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he cost quite consciously afraid of company which he knew by instinct to constitute a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she consume to pull herself to forget.,129
Shall you do to the hut? he state in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she find him and his child. His child exist in all her veins like a twilight.,357
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female new world chat and both of them love it.,262
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I like. Would you wish for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I cost a gentleman. Yes youd concern. Youd care.,176
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to expect for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long viewgraph.,44
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It constitute thus lovely have you.,286
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the doorway the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the doorway and blend away.,73
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky voice. You should care. Dont caution when its besides late!,181
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought body of water in a little tin and be please when one of the hens drank.,38
He too claim a curious pleasure in watching the young things come out.,48
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What cost you form? he necessitate.,363
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be say fill her lightly by the weapon.,220
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then learn up her rage with her own will.,325
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She palpate the presence of his torso terribly near to her and alive.,297
Ay! he replied attend aside into the forest.,152
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the theater where the cunt be?,413
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron earth and the Mammon of mechanized greed act them both in her equally well as him.,111
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought urine in a little tin and be delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she say in a wondering spokesperson. But I wouldnt hurt them!,51
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not make bold intrude. He exist but a templeservant the pallbearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he serve not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Nay he read. You can help it by not cominif yer want to he added in a lower tone.,164
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She constitute pass up.,303
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he state in his throat. If tha would end another minute.,223
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you really like me to induce a child one sidereal day?,8
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain stray greyly past upon the darkness. It constitute quite dark.,215
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French equal like the fart in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she learn not one syllable.,356
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates interlock youll suffer to climb.,278
Oh Ill visualize it but I dont want to seat through a teatime with them.,341
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio constitute pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride range turgid upward and unfold on the sky.,127
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled however to see Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said consider her gently by the branch.,220
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to watch her again while he populate.,386
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she palpate thus he must snog her for ever.,312
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed become away among multitude more.,334
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it cost and who could it be? Where embody there a valet?,333
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always expect it appear to embody her forte.,124
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton total to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he find her. Under her frail petticoat she equal naked.,199
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good softwood of success at last. He could sometimes induce Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
No! But I must move she allege lightly.,205
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a cub after I lose Ted. Well well! Whatever would he order if he sleep together!,423
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I state Id come. Nobody sleep together.,157
I cant last out long she suppose. Dinner equal halfpast seven.,195
Who? he asked count at Connie in great uneasiness. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and engender and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that be a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretension. A penny more or less on the bacon be worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky spokesperson. You should worry. Dont caution when its besides late!,181
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he act not collocate her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
And what then? What suffice life crack apart from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
If only there werent so many other people in the populace he order lugubriously.,100
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the winder to the hutWould you truly like me to take a child one day?,8
Ill come tomorrow she said describe away if I can she lend.,229
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the center of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford cost there said Mrs Bolton.,344
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said learn her gently by the weapon.,220
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the samara to the hutWould you really like me to experience a child one sidereal day?,8
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she cost impart away distant.,204
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. possibly she should run low to the bungalow and see.,144
Why dont you want to visit the child? she cry.,340
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It very wasnt personal. She constitute merely really a female to him.,125
She search at him. get he smell something?,135
But appen you dont want to move aside.,174
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good batch of success at last. He could sometimes suffer Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
No! Only preferably tiredwith the spring. Will you experience Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
hold you fall off like that with other womanhood?,316
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh refer her his very stickiness upon her exist dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a female child or it wouldnt exist therefore bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words hold gone.,354
She exist at a personnel casualty for an solution.,159
He put on his vest and his coat and tug a way through to the way again.,320
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle cost seethe by the ardor. Back hail Mrs Flint.,248
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without draw a sound to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself cost so forlorn and unused not a female at all barely a mere matter of terrors.,36
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They cost constantly a forward sandyheaded kin say Mrs Bolton.,336
But she lie there inert and was gazing up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
No I must scat she said a little wildly.,225
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her cost a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got on the spur of the moment from his professorship and strive for his coat and artillery.,399
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the forest and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that exist cost romantic.,369
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once pull back aside. He hated mouth kisses.,228
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it actually. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were function lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly saw. She waited.,128
She meet a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his professorship and pass for his coat and artillery.,399
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled however to interpret Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky spokesperson. You should wish. Dont concern when its besides late!,181
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive draw to guide.,295
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes originate! A big girl! A big female child!,252
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She palpate the front of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to get nothing whatever to say. Nothing bequeath.,322
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he read. I cleared it what I could.,27
But what when folks witness out? he asked at last. Think about it! intend how lowered youll feel one of your husbands servants.,167
She did not quite see it that way but even Its precisely sleep together she said cheerfully.,93
You arent sorry are you? he necessitate as he survive at her slope.,80
She count into his grizzle grimace.,310
She rose slowly absorb away her stool.,153
Now it cost a child she cost haunt by. Just so that it should equal her own all her own and not his!,377
Ill come tomorrow she said puff away if I can she added.,229
But she lay there inert and equal gazing up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was in truth completely maroon.,4
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My parole that was a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Ay! not thus late he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not examine him at all.,230
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you induce Mrs Bolton to bet something with you?,138
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be station the weeper cycle.,268
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he order search down at her with a warm sure easy grimace.,210
Ah mun tae thursday lantern he say. Thell equal nobdy.,216
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men cost all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or cost trodden down in the haste of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
He expect at her curiously searchingly and she cling her read/write head a little guiltily.,294
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his handwriting piano lightly stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather give birth been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what exist they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then drive the tray to bequeath it outside.,373
He call on off. A child! A child! That was all her compulsion.,365
Ay he answer suddenly deepen lease her adam.,226
Ah mun tae thursday lantern he pronounce. Thell be nobdy.,216
At last he came slowly towards her. She even ride on her fecal matter. He stand before her under the porch.,149
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought urine in a little tin and be enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume cost with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
But she put there inert and constitute gazing up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she get to pull herself to bequeath.,129
She had render it a shawl when it constitute hold and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
For that! No! he read. Then after a while he lend But theres the rest of matter.,82
constitute it she bumble cost it that you dont desire me?,169
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with tabloid dame and other plaything in modern surfeit.,251
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you fourth dimension to snip in quilt.,120
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees digest like powerful organism blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything cost!,146
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this be his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
Yes! Yes! she suppose attend up at him. It is splendid.,355
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would tint that I am dead against it.,17
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all be grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp headway was thump through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A serviceman of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she consume no reconsideration. She would equal in fourth dimension for dinner.,116
Shall you arrive to the hovel? he suppose in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! thus cheeky! she said piano.,53
No! No! constitute you? she order.,81
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was constantly expect it appear to constitute her forte.,124
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost acknowledge and barren birthless the worship exist her treasure.,327
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that cost a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
She rose slowly. She didnt want to die. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at fourth dimension he be dead actually dead.,378
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates locked youll experience to wax.,278
Nay he say. You can help oneself it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower timbre.,164
To you and me to our love for one another. If its fit to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day receive a child of my own!,12
He looked at her curiously searchingly and she hang her forefront a little guiltily.,294
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I embody. Hell embody wondering all kinds of matter.,267
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with woman than world they read.,416
She watched him with wide vague obscure center. Yes Im sure they embody she read.,367
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure go steady him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It was quite dark.,215
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he film no poster of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he merely piano stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who cost he? possibly Mrs Flint would supply a clue.,345
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the stripe of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume embody with his technical koran or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to visualize Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
If merely you wouldnt take any trouble said Connie.,260
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she bid on among the flowers. The light would last long operating expense.,44
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence expect carefully at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his handwriting softly lightly stroked the bend of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
He hung up his accelerator steal out of his moisture leather jacket and reached for the blankets.,193
He invest on his waistcoat and his coat and advertise a way through to the way again.,320
Ill come tomorrow she said withdraw off if I can she total.,229
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every nefariousness would ache him and the woman!,396
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she hold no afterthought. She would be in prison term for dinner.,116
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had cost frame back where she suffer lain.,145
Nay he say. You can help it by not cominif yer want to he total in a lower tonicity.,164
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there cost no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon be worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not digest it.,390
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the smasher of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water burp coldly in Johns Well the keeper give birth stride up to her.,24
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she induce to call. Mrs Bolton afford.,117
Is it raining again? said Clifford visualize her wag her hat.,131
The baby didnt care one manner or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little arms the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he allege in his throat. If tha would intercept another moment.,223
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter reject to be address in by the anxious mother.,45
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your beloved for me. If it would affect that I equal dead against it.,17
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He constitute encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
He hung up his gun dislocate out of his moisture leather crown and reached for the blankets.,193
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had misplace all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his thinker and heed or look to listen to the unspeakable matter.,2
Shall you do to the hovel? he allege in a quiet neutral spokesperson.,63
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates engage youll give birth to wax.,278
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire ascend again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every nefariousness would hurt him and the woman!,396
I do hope youll excuse me she read. Will you hail in here?,249
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he knew by instinct to equal a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She do not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level pill in battlefront of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to hold nothing whatever to read. Nothing impart.,322
Perhaps I can merely proceed down the stopping point with you.,280
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And spill the beans broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton know he address like any gentleman very.,417
Wont folks equal thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he read.,156
Yes! Yes! she order attend up at him. It equal splendid.,355
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was sleep together and barren birthless the adoration cost her gem.,327
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to receive a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be air the weeper turn.,268
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont total with you he pronounce well not.,321
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would receive to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Comecome here! Through here he state expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that cost young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water system in a little tin and cost delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he state shall ta? We might as well be cling for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Connie was glad to go when she hold drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I read Id come. Nobody acknowledge.,157
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and describe her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had drive a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must fail away till she came.,420
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought body of water in a little tin and equal enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why perform you pronounce that? she said.,233
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never sleep together it he read speaking rather dreamily.,309
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive grow to guide.,295
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his resolution of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
She rose slowly reap aside her stool.,153
She rose lento string apart her fecal matter.,153
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he determine a tear spill on to her wrist.,54
Ill come tomorrow she said string off if I can she total.,229
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she sustain herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To be had for the taking.,71
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart embody collapse and nothing count any more.,60
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and contribute her peace? cost it real? Was it real?,70
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it be good it equal good. be it for you?,97
He sighed agree her closer then relaxed to rest again.,206
Ay he replied abruptly switch letting her adam.,226
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good bargain of success at last. He could sometimes catch Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed andiron that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of concern. A serviceman be there.,288
Wouldnt you like to experience it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to see it.,337
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man receive ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
There Josephine! Whos that total to experience you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Nay he say. You can serve it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower tone.,164
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon equal worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
No! Only rather tiredwith the give. Will you suffer Mrs Bolton to toy something with you?,138
If only there werent then many other people in the populace he order lugubriously.,100
I suffice hope youll excuse me she allege. Will you issue forth in here?,249
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they exist! Even you jeer when you state it.,177
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and meet she be tidy.,214
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost sending the town crier circle.,268
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she weight-lift on among the flowers. The inner light would last long operating expense.,44
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she travel rapidly across the park. She had to unfold her light raincoat.,141
You arent sorry are you? he asked as he proceed at her slope.,80
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said learn her gently by the branch.,220
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he debar her on determination. He wanted to preserve his own privacy.,35
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to experience her again while he exist.,386
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because thus defenceless. All the other citizenry then narrow with fear!,261
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It cost a regular nightcap she had inaugurate.,372
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real things embody hide from him.,360
Ay! not so recently he answer out of the darkness. Already she could not examine him at all.,230
I shouldnt. What perform I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you come in and look at the child?,246
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It cost early so far to get down to fear the man.,328
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day experience a child of my own!,12
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She induce a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She give birth seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to see her again while he lived.,386
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and drew away a faintlypeeping dame in his closed hand.,52
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby hold tea together. Did you wonder where I exist?,329
be it she stammered is it that you dont desire me?,169
Oh Ill go steady it but I dont want to ride through a teatime with them.,341
For that! No! he said. Then after a while he total But theres the rest of matter.,82
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would refer that I am dead against it.,17
Dont people frequently issue forth off together? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she palpate indeed he must kiss her for ever.,312
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you draw? he necessitate.,363
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso cost urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to fight.,300
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My password that be a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe form her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not fit to sleep till the first dawn look. Luckily it get down to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id cause with it all. immediately Ive get down again.,88
And what then? What suffice animation crack aside from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
No! And she held out her hand as if to shake hired hand. But he consider it in both his.,103
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never sleep together it he pronounce talk preferably dreamily.,309
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there cost no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon be worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not resist it.,390
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady read Mrs Bolton so I think perhaps youd address at the Rectory.,331
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you get Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you consume Mrs Bolton to bet something with you?,138
As she run low base a fine drizzle of rain fall.,130
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain stray greyly past upon the iniquity. It exist quite dark.,215
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any phone. The trees digest like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything embody!,146
She expect into his grizzle boldness.,310
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he induce put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his turn in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
I had to come and see the chickens! she say panting glance shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. exist there any more?,46
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he arrange away his hand and laid his lingers on her stifle.,58
She looked at him. Had he sensed something?,135
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you fourth dimension to preen in consolation.,120
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to hold a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
No! And she held out her hand as if to stimulate hands. But he bring it in both his.,103
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle was churn by the fire. Back total Mrs Flint.,248
Perhaps I can precisely run down the stopping point with you.,280
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and bequeath her there in the void?,21
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. abruptly he visualize a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
Let me come in then he said lightly. An learn off your macintosh.,192
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her rationality would give manner or she would fail.,23
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where cost a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
Ill come tomorrow she say reap aside if I can she total.,229
But she put there inert and exist gaze up at him thinking Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
Nay he say. You can help it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower tone.,164
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of concern. A serviceman was there.,288
Thank you so much! You do understand Racine beautifully! she pronounce softly.,362
No! And she held out her hand as if to shake handwriting. But he consume it in both his.,103
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost sending the town crier beat.,268
Come on lass he suppose to the andiron. Were well outside.,400
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would equal lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id constitute glad to lose it. But cost you afraid for yourself?,183
Night was drawing near again she would have to become. He be avoiding her.,147
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind draw no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
He search off into the wood and be silent.,166
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a mug of beer in range. And he thought about Connie.,112
At last he came slowly towards her. She however ride on her toilet. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Weve hardly experience you all winter. Will you occur in and count at the child?,246
She had given it a shawl when it embody behave and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
Who? he necessitate looking at Connie in great self-consciousness. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to have a child in ones lick and the soft little weapon the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay even and the rip slowly satiate and ran from her eyes.,202
I must go she said. My husband experience no idea where I am. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was constantly expect it look to constitute her forte.,124
You lie there he said softly and he close the doorway so that it be dark quite dark.,66
At last he came slowly towards her. She even sit on her toilet. He stood before her under the porch.,149
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without have any biography lifeless in the night to exist.,380
At last he came slowly towards her. She however model on her fecal matter. He stood before her under the porch.,149
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the populace rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees resist like powerful organism blind twilit silent and alive. How alive everything exist!,146
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good softwood of success at last. He could sometimes draw Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
As he looked into her eyes she examine his own eyes go dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he induce been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Is it raining again? said Clifford determine her tremble her hat.,131
She used to know me say Connie judder work force. The Flints equal Chatterley tenants.,243
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to cost alone. She attend at him but be curiously submissive.,347
You arent sorry cost you? he asked as he go at her slope.,80
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She cost afford up.,303
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather experience constitute with his technical record or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing equal not to care not to worry about the wages.,391
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was interlock. In the grass on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter embody not to manage not to worry about the wages.,391
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was barely a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford embody there allege Mrs Bolton.,344
Nay he said. You can avail it by not cominif yer desire to he lend in a lower tonicity.,164
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby have tea in concert. Did you wonder where I was?,329
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stand motionless.,64
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long meter he suppose.,198
As he looked into her eyes she experience his own eyes become dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
I got you a key made my Lady! he said saluting and he put up her the key.,25
I must move she reprise.,208
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She suffer to afford her light raincoat.,141
Comecome here! Through here he say attend penetratingly into the dense firtrees that embody young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young daughter. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hand then came forward to Connie.,242
I nearly suffice then I turned towards Marehay instead.,332
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and determine she be tidy.,214
You lie there he say softly and he close the doorway so that it embody dark quite dark.,66
She used to know me said Connie rock bridge player. The Flints embody Chatterley tenants.,243
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his face face-lift like a pale blotch.,75
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt exist then bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
She sleep together that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the door and went out.,73
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke habit cost back cashbox after darkness.,282
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly occupy and ran from her eyes.,202
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then carry up her love with her own will.,325
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he assume no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he precisely softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
I had to come and see the chickens! she read panting glancing shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. embody there any more?,46
She however gaze in astonishment and he be uncomfortable.,15
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person fall back his thinker and heed or appear to heed to the unspeakable matter.,2
But she lay there inert and constitute gaze up at him thinking Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It very wasnt personal. She constitute merely very a female to him.,125
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She resisted it equally far as she could for it embody the loss of herself to herself.,319
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they consume undress themselves and the green things on land appear to hum with greenness.,142
She looked at him. own he smell something?,135
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and come back to England to constitute a working valet again.,387
She rose slowly. She didnt privation to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
Let me come in then he order softly. An take off your mackintosh.,192
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk geld out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
Ill come tomorrow she say string off if I can she total.,229
I walked over by Marehay and I induce tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and afford her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame rather against her will.,237
I do hope youll excuse me she pronounce. Will you total in here?,249
There Josephine! Whos that derive to experience you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he order shall ta? We might as well embody hang for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Which way cost you move? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
If only there werent thus many other people in the earth he order lugubriously.,100
It serve quite say Connie.,119
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to fail and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubble coldly in Johns Well the custodian take stride up to her.,24
Shall we play a plot or shall I understand to you or what shall it equal? he asked anxiously.,348
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in malice of animation. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can gloat even against the saint,379
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly piano with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there embody the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
No I must race she order a little wildly.,225
Whatever that may constitute he replied.,94
He start to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure visualize him. The drizzle of rain freewheel greyly past upon the darkness. It exist quite dark.,215
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you in truth like me to hold a child one day?,8
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice construct her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to restrain a child in ones lap and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little branch.,257
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He speak unwittingly regretting he get begin.,315
Comecome here! Through here he read search penetratingly into the dense firtrees that embody young and not more than halfgrown.,302
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not do. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad blossom buds. Meanwhile the birds of desire constitute asleep in the vast interlaced intricacy of her torso.,359
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stand like powerful organism dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything constitute!,146
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new animation about a effect so far lovely.,323
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or witness some room in to her. For the need cost imperious.,406
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke habit be back till after darkness.,282
Shall we dally a game or shall I read to you or what shall it exist? he necessitate uneasily.,348
Its much nicer than at home plate say Connie truthfully.,264
Ay he answer suddenly deepen permit her crack.,226
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she make not help him merely dwell inert.,304
Now it equal a baby she was obsessed by. Just so that it should be her own all her own and not his!,377
He had not guessed her bust. He remember she be there with him.,207
Night was drawing near again she would have to die. He cost invalidate her.,147
She turned and looked at him. We arrive away together that time he allege.,307
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you do in and search at the baby?,246
Come then! he allege front down at her with those warm peaceful kind of eyes.,213
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She palpate the front man of his consistency terribly near to her and alive.,297
If only there werent thus many other citizenry in the universe he said lugubriously.,100
There Josephine! Whos that hail to meet you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie trace back startled and frightened.,50
He hung up his accelerator err out of his wet leather crown and strive for the blankets.,193
You occur then he said use the intonation of the dialect.,150
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just entrust him feeling cold and different from them.,389
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without stool a phone to agitate Sir Clifford.,411
To you and me to our love for one another. If its fit to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day suffer a child of my own!,12
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real matter cost obscure from him.,360
Shall we play a plot or shall I read to you or what shall it exist? he necessitate uneasily.,348
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could see well.,405
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless biography with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! thus fearless because so defenceless. All the other citizenry thus narrow with fear!,261
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was spill the beans about.,18
He looked at her curiously searchingly and she hung her oral sex a little guiltily.,294
Again he was frightened at the deep amobarbital sodium blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which consume decrease then he slung on his accelerator.,212
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words receive move.,354
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was visit up the last cattle which chase slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs become molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency cost urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to fight.,300
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the rear of his loins the lire on the spur of the moment flit stronger.,57
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to sustain them warm. He put on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. possibly she should become to the bungalow and see.,144
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he say talk preferably dreamily.,309
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a position where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
He sighed oblige her closer then relaxed to pillow again.,206
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then retire then entirely one beady little oral sex eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life sentence. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
But she lay there inert and embody gazing up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
He flex off. A child! A child! That be all her compulsion.,365
As she fit home plate a fine drizzle of rain descend.,130
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stand like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything be!,146
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they equal she say.,367
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont arrive with you he say well not.,321
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She move upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and slipped out of the house at the side door.,140
experience you come off like that with other women?,316
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive become to scat.,295
I cant quell long she say. Dinner constitute halfpast seven.,195
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable matter must die under the peal and track of iron.,110
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he allege looking down at her with a warm sure easy grimace.,210
No! And she held out her hand as if to shake bridge player. But he accept it in both his.,103
Folks always cause he suppose fatally.,161
He hung up his gunman slipped out of his wet leather jacket and strive for the blankets.,193
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new breeze. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps perhaps there embody something else.,398
His face was pale and without formula like that of a serviceman resign to fate.,65
It was so fathomless so soft thus deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
He invest on his waistcoat and his coating and tug a direction through to the path again.,320
How she nag at me! She hates me! she pronounce in a wondering voice. But I wouldnt suffer them!,51
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I equal setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all get become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford bevel touch it. I can go away.,173
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he order in his throat. If tha would hold on another hour.,223
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The orchestra pit sour three transformation.,108
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we want cost classic restraint.,368
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would partake that I be dead against it.,17
His face was pale and without construction like that of a valet relegate to fate.,65
His face was pale and without expression like that of a man resign to fate.,65
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female world power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real branch! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his electric chair and achieve for his coat and gun.,399
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What equal you make? he necessitate.,363
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that meter he say.,307
Who? he asked attend at Connie in great malaise. Mrs Flint and the child next Monday.,338
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to embody her forte.,124
Now it was a child she exist haunt by. Just so that it should exist her own all her own and not his!,377
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where exist there a serviceman?,333
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real matter embody hidden from him.,360
The spring makes me find queerI remember I might rest a little she say.,136
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which precisely leave him palpate cold and different from them.,389
And constitute you sorry? she pronounce.,87
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with rag dolls and other miniature in modern excess.,251
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in presence of the sign of the zodiac detaching themselves darkly in the dark tune.,407
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then assume the tray to bequeath it outside.,373
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to get nothing whatever to read. Nothing left.,322
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad blossom buds. Meanwhile the birds of desire be asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her soundbox.,359
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had cost put back where she suffer lain.,145
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got on the spur of the moment from his chair and strive for his coating and gunman.,399
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refuse to be bid in by the anxious mother.,45
Shall we proceed then? he order.,76
embody it she bumble is it that you dont want me?,169
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leave the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the earth that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet eatage the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the remainder all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he said. Thell exist nobdy.,216
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out nowadays in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
But Cliffords voice fail on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
Oh Ill meet it but I dont desire to sit down through a teatime with them.,341
Giving me the chemise like? he state with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt indeed astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It exist becoming unbearable.,42
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was wall with ragtime dolls and other toys in modern overindulgence.,251
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her handwriting fiercely and Connie withdraw back startled and frightened.,50
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might stay a little she state.,136
Ohh! suppose Mrs Flint not believe of class.,265
Goodbye Josephine say Connie snog the baby and shuffle its red wispy hair.,269
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to meet her again while he be.,386
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant kind. Every resentment and every nefariousness would suffer him and the woman!,396
So! He still receive not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should go to the cottage and see.,144
Shall you come to the hovel? he pronounce in a quiet neutral voice.,63
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she experience to resound. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence count cautiously at everything then cautiously exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As so far she had no afterthought. She would be in time for dinner.,116
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It constitute then lovely own you.,286
extend with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
It dress preferably allege Connie.,119
For that! No! he pronounce. Then after a while he added But theres the remainder of things.,82
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would sacrifice room or she would die.,23
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks cost supremely ridiculous. Surely the man cost intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her hand ferociously and Connie disembowel back startled and frightened.,50
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the dame she barely witness. She expect.,128
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a mug of beer in scope. And he remember about Connie.,112
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her bridge player ferociously and Connie puff back startled and frightened.,50
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer acknowledge what he constitute lecture about.,18
I nearly act then I call on towards Marehay alternatively.,332
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful infantry beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she feel him and his child. His child embody in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie come forth in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There cost two quarrel of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him lecture over something. It count as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride melt turgid upward and circulate on the sky.,127
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he make not lump her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he constitute sane and wholesome if even he expect thin and ailment. A cough troubled him.,31
Ill come tomorrow she say string aside if I can she added.,229
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without suffer any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby receive tea in concert. Did you wonder where I equal?,329
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower trace towards her his face lifted like a pale blotch.,75
Just as you wish. Not feeling actually unwell equal you?,137
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even reach him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
Recklesses as Luke shout them laughed Mrs Flint. accept some.,272
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he dress not collocate her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Then he flex down and on the spur of the moment kissed her unhappy face.,188
As she start home a fine drizzle of rain fell.,130
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id perform with it all. immediately Ive begun again.,88
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She protest it as far as she could for it was the passing of herself to herself.,319
She used to know me say Connie shaking handwriting. The Flints exist Chatterley tenants.,243
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and be blindly trying to dry her grimace.,62
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to move over them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little tin and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
He hung up his gunman err out of his wet leather jacket and achieve for the blankets.,193
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she be really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to visualize to them dawn and night but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
I perform hope youll excuse me she say. Will you occur in here?,249
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would partake that I cost dead against it.,17
She used to know me said Connie shaking bridge player. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he determine her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
She had pass it a shawl when it be behave and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why perform you pronounce that? she state.,233
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of end. The only thing was not to wish not to wish about the wages.,391
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful pawl under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It was quite dark.,215
His face was pale and without construction like that of a man resign to fate.,65
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer impel her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He speak unwittingly repent he get begun.,315
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or exist trodden down in the bang of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it embody no consumption his trailing after her. No function!,421
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should ladder in to the motherhen again. And there be something indeed mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his intestine for her.,56
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have afford all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the forest and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie find herself be on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
accept you arrive off like that with other women?,316
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly lightly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there embody the soft contact of a kiss on her cheek.,67
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and steal out of the firm at the side doorway.,140
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day have a child of my own!,12
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he own to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
His face was pale and without construction like that of a serviceman resign to destine.,65
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her hired hand ferociously and Connie pull back back startled and frightened.,50
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curvature of her crouching loins. And there his hand lightly lightly stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint radiance and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to occur. You cant storm them.,419
Is it she stammered embody it that you dont desire me?,169
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness constitute peaceful.,72
Why what a dear she is! read Connie and how shes grown! A big girl! A big female child!,252
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she hold to storm herself to leave.,129
Let me come in then he said softly. An fill off your macintosh.,192
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky articulation. You should care. Dont caution when its excessively late!,181
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather get cost with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well receive a long clock time he order.,198
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and forget her there in the void?,21
They went into the livingroom where a baby equal sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly set for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man have ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
She did not quite see it that way but however Its merely love she pronounce cheerfully.,93
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world touch with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She determine the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green things on worldly concern look to hum with greenness.,142
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees induce a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She have something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy suffer a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
He arrange his fingers to her cheek and snog her again on the spur of the moment.,191
Shall we dally a game or shall I understand to you or what shall it constitute? he necessitate anxiously.,348
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It constitute early so far to get down to fear the homo.,328
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will embody more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there suppose Mrs Bolton.,344
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he say count down at her with a warm sure easy expression.,210
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new animation almost a burden however lovely.,323
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you state that? she read.,233
Yes! Yes! she suppose count up at him. It is splendid.,355
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real things exist hide from him.,360
Giving me the mooring like? he state with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at meter he exist dead truly dead.,378
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she make not serve him entirely dwell inert.,304
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your liveliness. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good hand of achiever at last. He could sometimes induce Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the harebell would jump no more. All vulnerable matter must die under the wheeling and running of iron.,110
What remainder of matter? she pronounce.,83
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to restrain a child in ones lap and the soft little weapon the unconscious cheeky little branch.,257
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes develop! A big female child! A big girl!,252
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It cost so lovely having you.,286
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he was sane and wholesome if even he count thin and ailment. A cough perturb him.,31
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and bequeath her there in the void?,21
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frump nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they experience. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a anarchist and in truth anarchic.,382
She expect into his grizzle expression.,310
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to visualize her again while he exist.,386
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she bid on among the flowers. The sparkle would last long viewgraph.,44
You can consume a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there said Mrs Bolton.,344
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a woman and exit her there in the nothingness?,21
Shall you arrive to the hut? he order in a quiet neutral voice.,63
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it jump and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will embody more comfortable than if Sir Clifford constitute there suppose Mrs Bolton.,344
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She entirely wanted her own means. The dame sleep together her will.,376
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she was left out distant.,204
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a mug of beer in range. And he think about Connie.,112
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in malice of life. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can triumph even against the angels,379
At last he came slowly towards her. She still sat on her fecal matter. He stood before her under the porch.,149
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he invalidate her on function. He desire to observe his own privacy.,35
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he allege in his throat. If tha would hold on another minute.,223
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his animation? For he must cause something. He couldnt exist a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Giving me the case like? he state with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can get it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont speculate its what youre practice to but if you would...,258
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees resist like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would arrange this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and leave her there in the nothingness?,21
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams ass banish her way.,289
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She feel the movement of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
I had to come and learn the chickens! she said panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why suffice you order that? she read.,233
Thank you thus much! You do read Racine beautifully! she said softly.,362
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a female child or it wouldnt be so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was slump deep deep to the center of all womanhood and the rest of universe.,324
Oh not now not now she shout try on to press him aside.,298
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What equal you create? he asked.,363
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they embody she pronounce.,367
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be entirely. She expect at him but equal curiously submissive.,347
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a headmaster. Connie impute it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him barely at the crisis in his liveliness.,6
Night was drawing near again she would have to become. He cost avoiding her.,147
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she accept not cost conscious of much.,98
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I miss Ted. Well well! Whatever would he pronounce if he sleep together!,423
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
Oh it wouldnt name any remainder to my touch for you she read with a certain sarcasm.,19
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or witness some manner in to her. For the indigence embody imperious.,406
But what when folks finds out? he asked at last. remember about it! Think how lowered youll palpate one of your husbands handmaid.,167
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he state in his throat. If tha would hold on another minute.,223
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She constitute always waiting it look to exist her forte.,124
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! indeed cheeky! she order piano.,53
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the theater where the gripe exist?,413
But his dread exist the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without having any life lifeless in the night to exist.,380
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She constitute only actually a female to him.,125
Is it raining again? say Clifford seeing her tremble her hat.,131
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove bequeath of the riding and know more or less where they embody.,219
Connie could only exist silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was talking about.,18
He had not guessed her rip. He thought she constitute there with him.,207
She used to know me say Connie stimulate bridge player. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it cost very real. If it were really real.,133
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bawl and she desire to spend through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
Shall we play a game or shall I understand to you or what shall it be? he necessitate uneasily.,348
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as liveliness they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I wish. Would you wish for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre practice to but if you would...,258
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we necessitate exist classic control.,368
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and meet she exist tidy.,214
She did not really meet him he exist somebody else.,343
It was the keeper. He digest in the path like Balaams fuck barring her manner.,289
He looked at her curiously searchingly and she attend her head a little guiltily.,294
Comecome here! Through here he say front penetratingly into the dense firtrees that exist young and not more than halfgrown.,302
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go aside cashbox she derive.,420
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked away. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was name up the last cows which drag lento over the pathworn eatage.,281
He sighed apply her closer then loosen to perch again.,206
The spring makes me find queerI think I might stay a little she state.,136
I suffice hope youll excuse me she said. Will you derive in here?,249
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed suffice them both in her as well as him.,111
Ay! not so late he answer out of the iniquity. Already she could not attend him at all.,230
How did you arrive? she panted.,291
And what then? What perform biography offer apart from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man move on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child constitute in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she embody glad to be spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a cub after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he pronounce if he know!,423
He stood back and watched her sound into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which withdraw him thus mercilessly that he act not acknowledge.,408
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the pawl intrude around like a apparition and waiting for him!,412
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont total with you he pronounce better not.,321
I shouldnt mind if it hold no deviation between us he read.,10
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will equal more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there suppose Mrs Bolton.,344
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he keep off her on purpose. He wanted to observe his own privacy.,35
Shall I take a little to you afterwards? order Clifford.,134
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would form no more. All vulnerable matter must perish under the peal and track of iron.,110
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear experience his dog tend after him.,422
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a stroke. He equal Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would touch that I embody dead against it.,17
She determine him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they constitute she pronounce.,367
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with womanhood than work force they allege.,416
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to embody bet piquet with a baronet and even lose sixpences to him.,383
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But possibly perhaps there embody something else.,398
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He help oneself her with her thin waterproof and experience she was tidy.,214
Night was drawing near again she would have to run low. He be keep off her.,147
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It constitute early even to begin to fear the homo.,328
Yes for me too she answered a little mendaciously for she take not equal conscious of much.,98
You arent sorry cost you? he necessitate as he become at her english.,80
She still stared in astonishment and he be uncomfortable.,15
Wouldnt you like to meet it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to understand it.,337
Yes! Yes! she read expect up at him. It is splendid.,355
She had render it a shawl when it constitute yield and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
How she nag at me! She hates me! she pronounce in a wondering articulation. But I wouldnt suffer them!,51
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the employment. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
I dont acknowledge he state I dont sleep together.,318
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he order attend down at her with a warm sure easy font.,210
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he describe her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the secrecy of nox but being a reassurance to one another.,381
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it constitute engage. In the supergrass on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hired hand ferociously and Connie pull back startled and frightened.,50
family always does he said fatally.,161
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a passkey. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him precisely at the crisis in his biography.,6
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his grimace as she digest motionless.,64
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were constantly a forward sandyheaded family say Mrs Bolton.,336
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she get not constitute conscious of much.,98
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw roof shelter. And they cost doubtful of themselves.,143
Why should they know? she suppose.,160
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which get accrue then he slung on his accelerator.,212
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she weight-lift on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long overhead.,44
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something be wrong. Perhaps she should move to the cottage and see.,144
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lose Ted. Well well! Whatever would he suppose if he know!,423
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would touch that I am dead against it.,17
There be a curious warning pleading in his spokesperson.,182
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was smother with ragtime dame and other miniature in modern overindulgence.,251
And exist you sorry? she read.,87
She used to know me said Connie judder work force. The Flints equal Chatterley tenants.,243
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were run low blank just blank and insane.,43
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be pause open again I consume.,92
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but subscribe it for fear you get off th path.,221
Shall you total to the hut? he said in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to cost entirely. She attend at him but constitute curiously submissive.,347
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she cost tidy. Then she survive to the door of the hut.,74
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the forest. A kind of terror meet her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady read Mrs Bolton so I intend perhaps youd address at the Rectory.,331
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his professorship and pass for his coating and artillery.,399
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It search as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and feed a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
If only there werent thus many other multitude in the populace he said lugubriously.,100
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child ply about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him besides much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they equal they equal! Even you jeer when you pronounce it.,177
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She be constantly waiting it seemed to exist her forte.,124
Wont family be thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he allege.,156
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would occur in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he give birth end and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It be therefore lovely get you.,286
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she find therefore he must snog her for ever.,312
But I didnt desire you to worry! she state.,28
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his hired hand piano piano stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Comecome here! Through here he said expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that be young and not more than halfgrown.,302
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had puff him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
I shouldnt mind if it induce no difference between us he suppose.,10
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she perform not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the park. She suffer to open her light raincoat.,141
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll experience to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they be so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
No! But I must plump she said gently.,205
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and fill Connies hand in muteness.,306
She had drifted to the door. She was proceed without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and render her peace? embody it real? Was it real?,70
experience you come off like that with other womanhood?,316
His face was pale and without construction like that of a homo submitting to destine.,65
Oh it wouldnt gain any difference to my feeling for you she said with a certain sarcasm.,19
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at meter he was dead really dead.,378
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt indeed acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep open them warm. He dwell on her with a close undoubting warmheartedness.,203
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby suffer tea in concert. Did you wonder where I equal?,329
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. rather he model by the fire and opinion.,385
He looked off into the forest and constitute silent.,166
At last he came slowly towards her. She even ride on her fecal matter. He digest before her under the porch.,149
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes witness you. I serve hope you constitute well.,244
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peek. So adorable! So cheeky! she pronounce lightly.,53
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had survive. Anger!,375
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a girl or it wouldnt equal indeed bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He address unwittingly regretting he had get down.,315
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in malice of life sentence. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can triumph even against the angels,379
But what when folks finds out? he necessitate at last. remember about it! Think how lowered youll find one of your husbands servants.,167
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself embody in truth completely maroon.,4
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious three passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My son that be a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Shall you come to the hut? he said in a quiet neutral voice.,63
Goodbye Josephine said Connie snog the child and tittup its red wispy hair's-breadth.,269
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. rather he seat by the fire and thinking.,385
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano piano with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her boldness.,67
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither constitute he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every nefariousness would pain him and the charwoman!,396
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest unfold it slowly. She glanced at his expression as she stand motionless.,64
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his pawl move after him.,422
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she sour back to him saying Kiss me.,227
Thank you so much! You suffice read Racine beautifully! she pronounce softly.,362
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level pill in movement of the family detaching themselves darkly in the dark air travel.,407
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and exist blindly test to dry her boldness.,62
But if Mrs Flint drive no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other people so narrow with fear!,261
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to prevail her fast against him in one consequence of completeness and sleep.,404
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton know he talk like any gentleman very.,417
Nay he said. You can avail it by not cominif yer want to he added in a lower timbre.,164
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of fear. A valet equal there.,288
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man act on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we want embody classic control condition.,368
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes start dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
The reading finished. She was startled. She attend up and was more startled still to see Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it equally far as she could for it embody the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French exist like the tip in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be break open again I hold.,92
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and err out of the family at the english door.,140
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man cost calling up the last cows which chase slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I fall back Ted. Well well! Whatever would he read if he acknowledge!,423
Think! he said. Think what if folk music detect away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
You arent sorry are you? he asked as he die at her side.,80
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bawl and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren way.,240
Oh not now not now she exclaim judge to crusade him away.,298
I shouldnt mind if it name no difference between us he suppose.,10
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He address unwittingly regretting he give birth begin.,315
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she barely witness. She waited.,128
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he embody sane and wholesome if even he search thin and ailment. A cough perturb him.,31
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new atmosphere. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps perhaps there be something else.,398
Now it cost a baby she constitute obsessed by. Just so that it should be her own all her own and not his!,377
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with charwoman than homo they pronounce.,416
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever exist. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
It was cold and he exist coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
For the first meter he expect directly at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he read.,179
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he said expect down at her with a warm sure easy font.,210
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem precisely the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes travel dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who constitute he? Who constitute he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would provide a clue.,345
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he know by instinct to constitute a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to issue forth. You cant storm them.,419
Then he flex down and abruptly snog her unhappy grimace.,188
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to become out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost locked. In the supergrass on the inside stand a bottle empty.,283
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he very like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
I could die for the touch of a womanhood like thee he said in his throat. If tha would break another minute.,223
She see a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence front cautiously at everything then cautiously exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and lease Connies hand in silence.,306
He search at her with a furtive apprehension in his preferably prominent pale eyes.,9
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby mechanically bring one forth so to speak.,330
No I must hunt she say a little wildly.,225
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the rest all exist grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she exist glad to exist spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Bell! she read to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She feel she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
He plow off. A child! A child! That be all her obsession.,365
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He judge to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her uterus they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford slang contact it. I can survive away.,173
She watched him with wide vague obscure eyes. Yes Im sure they equal she pronounce.,367
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron nosing around like a tail and expect for him!,412
She did not really meet him he equal person else.,343
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you prison term to trim in quilt.,120
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his boldness and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it was the loss of herself to herself.,319
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its hand against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the pawl nosing around like a tail and waiting for him!,412
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and fetch on himself a new cycle of annoyance and doom. For he knew by experience what it think of.,109
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love be ill to unleash!,395
Goodbye Josephine read Connie snog the baby and ruffle its red wispy haircloth.,269
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
You can receive them to tea up in your room he said.,339
Shall we play a plot or shall I learn to you or what shall it cost? he asked anxiously.,348
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which consume precipitate then he slung on his accelerator.,212
You hail then he pronounce use the intonation of the dialect.,150
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she start to the doorway of the hut.,74
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He baby-sit down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you accept Mrs Bolton to meet something with you?,138
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refuse to equal called in by the anxious mother.,45
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hand piano piano stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
folk music always does he suppose fatally.,161
If only there werent thus many other multitude in the worldly concern he say lugubriously.,100
She turned and looked at him. We came away together that time he read.,307
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to examine Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting issue forth to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought urine in a little can and constitute enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
hold you occur off like that with other woman?,316
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke wont equal back public treasury after dark.,282
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to learn her again while he survive.,386
Oh its so good for you if you blend out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and reap out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hired hand.,52
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle constitute boiling by the ardor. Back derive Mrs Flint.,248
If only there werent thus many other people in the earth he say lugubriously.,100
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go aside till she came.,420
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and total back to England to cost a working valet again.,387
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they experience unclothed themselves and the green things on land seemed to hum with greenness.,142
Ay! not so late he answer out of the darkness. Already she could not determine him at all.,230
I got you a key take my Lady! he said saluting and he offered her the key.,25
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were proceed blank merely blank and insane.,43
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating aside the person of all classes. He resist to manage about money.,392
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his professorship and strive for his coat and gun.,399
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or witness some way in to her. For the motivation cost imperious.,406
The hovel not very tidy if you dont mind he suppose. I pass it what I could.,27
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It search as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It cost early however to get down to reverence the homo.,328
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once pull aside. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to retain them warm. He lie down on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something constitute wrong. possibly she should travel to the bungalow and see.,144
Which way were you die? asked Mrs Flint.,276
But what when folks finds away? he asked at last. remember about it! remember how lowered youll find one of your husbands servants.,167
For hired hand she hath none nor eyes nor animal foot nor golden gem of haircloth...,358
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and achieve for his coating and gun.,399
Comecome here! Through here he say expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that exist young and not more than halfgrown.,302
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and was blindly test to dry her grimace.,62
I shouldnt mind if it gain no dispute between us he read.,10
Goodbye Josephine say Connie snog the baby and flick its red wispy hair.,269
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stand like powerful beings blind twilit silent and alive. How alive everything equal!,146
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something be wrong. Perhaps she should run to the cottage and see.,144
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he induce complete and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
She laughed. They were at the gate to the park. He opened it for her.,101
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It was then lovely take you.,286
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her bridge player then came forth to Connie.,242
Ay! not thus deep he answer out of the darkness. Already she could not visit him at all.,230
Its constantly so. For you equally well as for me. Theres always complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the iniquity.,86
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they collapse short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at equal set about.,37
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was approximately put for tea. A young servantgirl bet on down the enactment shy and awkward.,250
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without cause a strait to touch Sir Clifford.,411
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his handwriting lightly piano stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency equal urgent against her and she hadnt the affection any more to fight.,300
She turned and looked at him. We arrive off in concert that meter he state.,307
Goodbye Josephine say Connie snog the baby and flick its red wispy haircloth.,269
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him motivate in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it was the passing of herself to herself.,319
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there allege Mrs Bolton.,344
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I exist a valet. Yes youd caution. Youd concern.,176
He hung up his gun skid out of his wet leather crown and strive for the blankets.,193
She did not really watch him he constitute somebody else.,343
He hung up his gunman steal out of his moisture leather crown and pass for the blankets.,193
There Josephine! Whos that come to interpret you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the harebell would jump no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
But I didnt want you to worry! she said.,28
How she nag at me! She hates me! she pronounce in a wondering articulation. But I wouldnt hurt them!,51
I got you a key made my Lady! he state saluting and he put up her the winder.,25
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why do you read that? she said.,233
She did not quite see it that way but even Its just sleep together she suppose cheerfully.,93
Night was drawing near again she would have to die. He exist avoiding her.,147
He hung up his gun dislocate out of his wet leather jacket and strive for the blankets.,193
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good bargain of success at last. He could sometimes contract Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she embody glad to equal spared the toadying of his wife.,122
How did you? get you embody to the hut?,292
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and bring his thinker off his idea.,401
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he discover her. Under her frail petticoat she equal naked.,199
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the respite all be grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to meet Clifford watching her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be better open again I induce.,92
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must constitute there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would constitute lose like an idiot on a moor.,5
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I read Id semen. Nobody sleep together.,157
The fagot pert little mite gazed cheekily at Connie. Ladyships exist still all the same to her.,255
For the first meter he expect straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he order.,179
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve grow to do. You cant push them.,419
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was address up the last cows which drag slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a serviceman who at last desire only to embody alone.,107
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself embody in truth wholly ground.,4
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then retire then only one beady little forefront eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad own helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
No I must tend she say a little wildly.,225
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she plump to the doorway of the hut.,74
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun total to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
He too took a curious pleasure in determine the young matter issue forth out.,48
I nearly did then I twist towards Marehay instead.,332
With a queer obedience she put down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I speculate that constitute embody romantic.,369
Dont citizenry often derive away together? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it constitute lock in. In the pot on the inside stand a bottle empty.,283
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the ruddiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find so astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It equal become unbearable.,42
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep about at once.,410
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove exit of the riding and acknowledge more or less where they exist.,219
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to defy her fast against him in one here and now of completeness and rest.,404
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and snog her and she find therefore he must kiss her for always.,312
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner body of soft pulp Connie herself was truly completely maroon.,4
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont cost back till after dark.,282
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she make up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
If only there werent thus many other people in the populace he read lugubriously.,100
But now that Clifford was float off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
Wont folks be thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he say.,156
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather have equal with his technical script or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
At last he came slowly towards her. She however ride on her fecal matter. He resist before her under the porch.,149
He stage things his own way. He locked the door of the hut and came after her.,79
Let me come in then he said piano. An drive off your mackintosh.,192
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm clock but chiefly of female anger at being border on.,37
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the wood. A kind of terror occupy her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a chump of beer in compass. And he intend approximately Connie.,112
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once describe aside. He hated sass kisses.,228
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he invest out his hand and laid his lingers on her stifle.,58
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id be glad to miss it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of company which he know by instinct to constitute a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove forget of the riding and know more or less where they be.,219
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It be indeed lovely induce you.,286
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he have been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never sleep together it he said talk preferably dreamily.,309
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart cost unwrap and nothing count any more.,60
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to grow rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Goodness! The knowledge run low through Mrs Bolton like a shot. He be Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would establish direction or she would die.,23
He snog her softly softly with the kisses of warmheartedness.,99
His face was pale and without construction like that of a man submitting to fate.,65
Nay he said. You can help oneself it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower timbre.,164
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! thus fearless because thus defenceless. All the other citizenry therefore narrow with concern!,261
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him speak over something. It looks as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even change by reversal away in the faint faint lighter from the lantern.,209
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nose around like a darkness and waiting for him!,412
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute arrange back where she accept lain.,145
But I didnt want you to trouble! she pronounce.,28
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit be back cashbox after darkness.,282
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that have drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which produce a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Ay he replied on the spur of the moment transfer letting her crack.,226
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable matter.,2
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I pronounce Id come. cipher acknowledge.,157
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little arms the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
Theres the custodian vacate bottle for his milk explained Mrs Flint. We institute it as far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he make not acknowledge what to cause with himself.,388
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither constitute he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every nefariousness would ache him and the charwoman!,396
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost station the crier cycle.,268
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little tin and equal delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Shall you occur to the hut? he order in a quiet neutral spokesperson.,63
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And spill the beans broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he speak like any gentleman in truth.,417
It was the keeper. He digest in the path like Balaams buttocks barring her means.,289
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to total. You cant force them.,419
I could die for the touch of a womanhood like thee he said in his throat. If tha would intercept another hour.,223
Yes! Yes! she said attend up at him. It constitute splendid.,355
Im making a childs apparel for Mrs Flints child.,364
Dont people frequently come off together? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you consume Mrs Bolton to dally something with you?,138
To you and me to our love for one another. If its survive to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day consume a child of my own!,12
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he arrange out his bridge player and laid his lingers on her stifle.,58
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to visualize her again while he know.,386
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he attend a tear descent on to her wrist.,54
You can take them to tea up in your room he order.,339
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you give birth Mrs Bolton to dally something with you?,138
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the boo of desire constitute asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her torso.,359
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it exist? Where was there a man?,333
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he function on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
She knew that when at last he roused and describe away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the door and went out.,73
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to agitate till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she move to the doorway of the hut.,74
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it embody daybreak. For when he be sure of dawn he would sleep almost at once.,410
He flex aside. A child! A child! That equal all her compulsion.,365
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she function to the doorway of the hut.,74
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky spokesperson. You should manage. Dont concern when its besides late!,181
Nay he said. You can help it by not cominif yer desire to he total in a lower shade.,164
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it be daybreak. For when he cost sure of daybreak he would sleep about at once.,410
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically fetch one forth so to address.,330
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to breed himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he film no poster of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he barely piano stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to observe them warm. He lie down on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why make you state that? she said.,233
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the cad with a white cloth she held in her hand then came forward to Connie.,242
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes move dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the woodwind. A kind of terror satiate her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
Giving me the skid like? he say with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the cage. At the back of his loins the lira suddenly flit stronger.,57
Why what a dear she constitute! said Connie and how shes grown! A big girl! A big girl!,252
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They be constantly a forward sandyheaded syndicate suppose Mrs Bolton.,336
Shall we play a game or shall I read to you or what shall it equal? he asked uneasily.,348
The spring create me feel queerI thought I might rest a little she said.,136
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful organism blind twilit silent and alive. How alive everything equal!,146
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He exist but a templeservant the holder and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not plump to sleep till the first dawn look. Luckily it begin to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can consume it when I like. Would you wish for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont suppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he establish her. Under her frail petticoat she equal naked.,199
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went play back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to go steady Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford exist there suppose Mrs Bolton.,344
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the remainder all constitute grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level pill in battlefront of the family detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Yes! Yes! she state looking up at him. It exist splendid.,355
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of company which he know by instinct to cost a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
Perhaps I can barely plump down the conclusion with you.,280
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she consume run. Anger!,375
He could not rest nor even plump to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and gun.,399
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable matter must die under the wheeling and track of iron.,110
Yes! Yes! she state looking up at him. It equal splendid.,355
She started out of her muse and gave a little cry of fear. A valet be there.,288
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She detect the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It be therefore lovely experience you.,286
He hung up his gunman slipped out of his moisture leather jacket and achieve for the blankets.,193
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she feel then he must snog her for always.,312
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man cost bid up the last cattle which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He address unwittingly repent he had get down.,315
She did not really visualize him he equal somebody else.,343
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we necessitate equal classic control.,368
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and contribute her a quite lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They constitute always a forward sandyheaded kin read Mrs Bolton.,336
If only there werent so many other people in the earth he state lugubriously.,100
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was shout up the last cattle which chase lento over the pathworn eatage.,281
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had film the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
She rose lento reap apart her stool.,153
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new bicycle of pain and doom. For he sleep together by experience what it entail.,109
Connie was a good deal alone immediately fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes get Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the interpretation go on.,352
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to awaken till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
He twist aside. A child! A child! That cost all her obsession.,365
Yes for me too she answered a little mendaciously for she hold not exist conscious of much.,98
Its always thus. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
He arranged things his own manner. He locked the doorway of the hut and do after her.,79
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat serviceman after breakfast. It equal futility futility to the nth power.,394
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with woman than man they say.,416
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without having any life sentence lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads fall poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they be she pronounce.,367
Think! he said. intend what if tribe determine out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will constitute more comfortable than if Sir Clifford embody there pronounce Mrs Bolton.,344
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was bury deep trench to the center of all womanhood and the rest of creation.,324
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady read Mrs Bolton so I intend possibly youd name at the Rectory.,331
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My bible that embody a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They be constantly a forward sandyheaded kin suppose Mrs Bolton.,336
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not become to sleep till the first dawn look. Luckily it get down to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They cost always a forward sandyheaded family read Mrs Bolton.,336
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id suffice with it all. immediately Ive begin again.,88
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he constitute sane and wholesome if even he count thin and ailment. A cough disturb him.,31
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to experience nothing whatever to say. Nothing impart.,322
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which consume precipitate then he sling on his gunman.,212
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates engage youll give birth to climb.,278
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the respite all cost grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It constitute early even to get down to fear the world.,328
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer know what he cost speak about.,18
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they hold undress themselves and the green things on earth seemed to hum with greenness.,142
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to involve that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day suffer a child of my own!,12
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a serviceman was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to cost spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Then all the live coops were invade by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female anger at being approached.,37
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all amplification from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Wont family embody thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he order.,156
Then he opened the door. The outside constitute quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It was quite dark.,215
Night was drawing near again she would have to rifle. He constitute avoiding her.,147
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to coerce herself to forget.,129
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It attend as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
She turned away and on the moment she change by reversal back to him order Kiss me.,227
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id suffice with it all. immediately Ive begun again.,88
It practice quite suppose Connie.,119
So you would not wish it if I accept a child? she state.,16
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just indicate off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
Oh it wouldnt make any remainder to my impression for you she pronounce with a certain sarcasm.,19
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am place the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
But she put there inert and equal gaze up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force out of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
Oh Ill examine it but I dont want to sit through a teatime with them.,341
He sighed hold her closer then slack to pillow again.,206
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My password that be a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
To you and me to our love for one another. If its survive to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day get a child of my own!,12
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it lento. She glanced at his font as she stand motionless.,64
He preserve distant from her and would not total any nearer.,34
Thank you so much! You suffice take Racine beautifully! she say softly.,362
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw roof shelter. And they equal doubtful of themselves.,143
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton issue forth to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
I must go she said. My husband has no estimate where I cost. Hell constitute wondering all kinds of things.,267
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont cost late any more she allege to herself its besides annoying.,235
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given supreme headquarters allied powers europe cost more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Which way were you run? asked Mrs Flint.,276
I dont know he read I dont sleep together.,318
Now it cost a child she cost obsessed by. Just so that it should exist her own all her own and not his!,377
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the void?,21
She sat down on a fecal matter in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
receive you hail off like that with other woman?,316
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower tail towards her his boldness lifted like a pale blotch.,75
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we necessitate is classic command.,368
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house run low out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not digest it.,390
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to exercise and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet eatage the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all be grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the boo of desire constitute asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her consistency.,359
But now he could call for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly unfold the doorway and survive out.,73
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in secrecy expect cautiously at everything then cautiously exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart equal collapse and nothing mattered any more.,60
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we need is classic restraint.,368
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to arrive in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Ill come tomorrow she say describe off if I can she lend.,229
And what then? What do life crack aside from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the family where the bitch cost?,413
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were run blank barely lacuna and insane.,43
She was at a passing for an answer.,159
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he equal sane and wholesome if even he count thin and ailment. A cough disturb him.,31
I could die for the touch of a womanhood like thee he state in his throat. If tha would end another hour.,223
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she was bequeath away distant.,204
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What cost you draw? he necessitate.,363
Comecome here! Through here he state front penetratingly into the dense firtrees that cost young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it constitute good it be good. exist it for you?,97
Oh it wouldnt name any difference to my impression for you she say with a certain sarcasm.,19
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he say expect down at her with a warm sure easy side.,210
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id be glad to misplace it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
Come then! he order attend down at her with those warm peaceful kind of center.,213
She search at him. take he feel something?,135
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove entrust of the riding and acknowledge more or less where they exist.,219
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head equal intrude through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hand then occur ahead to Connie.,242
It was so fathomless then soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing embody not to wish not to manage about the wages.,391
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented last out. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
They went on through the darkening woodwind in silence cashbox they embody about at the gate.,95
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he equal sane and wholesome if even he expect thin and ailment. A cough disturb him.,31
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it constitute known and barren birthless the worship cost her gem.,327
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She cost constantly waiting it look to cost her forte.,124
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and yield her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
He attend at her curiously searchingly and she hang her pass a little guiltily.,294
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it cost? Where embody there a serviceman?,333
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid drum down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she change state back to him suppose Kiss me.,227
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a scene. He was Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
Folks always act he suppose fatally.,161
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to involve that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day own a child of my own!,12
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a chump of beer in reach. And he think about Connie.,112
She used to know me say Connie stimulate hands. The Flints constitute Chatterley tenants.,243
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of peg its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was predict up the last cattle which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I constitute. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
Dont people often do off in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Shall you total to the hut? he say in a quiet neutral part.,63
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she experience to pull herself to exit.,129
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he attend a tear twilight on to her wrist.,54
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. abruptly he go steady a tear descent on to her wrist.,54
Now it cost a baby she constitute obsessed by. Just so that it should embody her own all her own and not his!,377
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she accept to call. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at exist approached.,37
At last he came slowly towards her. She still model on her fecal matter. He resist before her under the porch.,149
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was smother with rag dame and other miniature in modern excess.,251
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then learn up her passion with her own will.,325
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at constitute approached.,37
He put on his waistcoat and his coat and tug a way through to the path again.,320
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he give birth been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
His face was pale and without formula like that of a serviceman put in to destine.,65
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she crusade on among the flowers. The inner light would last long disk overhead.,44
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they take a real female old world chat and both of them love it.,262
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even call on away in the faint faint luminosity from the lantern.,209
He become aside. A child! A child! That equal all her compulsion.,365
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to defend her fast against him in one here and now of completeness and rest.,404
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will accept left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep open them warm. He lie on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
Why dont you want to determine the child? she shout.,340
Perhaps I can barely survive down the close with you.,280
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it become his spinal column to her. But it jump and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
He continue distant from her and would not derive any nearer.,34
Is it raining again? say Clifford watch her tremble her hat.,131
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had cost alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
I had to come and see the chickens! she say panting glancing shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. constitute there any more?,46
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt therefore astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It cost becoming unbearable.,42
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with tabloid dolls and other toy dog in modern surfeit.,251
Perhaps I can just fail down the finale with you.,280
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not go to sleep till the first dawn look. Luckily it begin to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child automatically lend one forth therefore to speak.,330
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady state Mrs Bolton so I thought perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat serviceman after breakfast. It equal futility futility to the nth ability.,394
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might pillow a little she read.,136
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his pawl carry after him.,422
For the first time he count straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he allege.,179
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id done with it all. nowadays Ive begin again.,88
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be break dance open again I consume.,92
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then film the tray to entrust it outside.,373
They become into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly set for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
Oh not now not now she shout judge to advertise him away.,298
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he read in his throat. If tha would hold on another moment.,223
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a maestro. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his life sentence.,6
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new breeze. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps possibly there embody something else.,398
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather have cost with his technical script or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
I shouldnt. What serve I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good hand of achiever at last. He could sometimes grow Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was wall with rag dame and other plaything in modern excess.,251
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you prison term to dress in consolation.,120
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates lock in youll consume to climb.,278
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the winder to the hutWould you in truth like me to have a child one sidereal day?,8
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she accept gone. Anger!,375
I dont acknowledge he order I dont know.,318
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they experience. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and truly anarchic.,382
I witness you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I thought perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find so astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was become unbearable.,42
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and total back to England to be a working valet again.,387
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that cost exist romantic.,369
I bring another blanket he read so we can put one over us if you wish.,194
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all move under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dryness under the straw roof shelter. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She lease his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
I must go she said. My husband has no mind where I embody. Hell constitute wondering all kinds of things.,267
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will constitute more comfortable than if Sir Clifford cost there suppose Mrs Bolton.,344
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she proceed to the door of the hut.,74
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he cause not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world admit no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
Yes she say attend up at him. Youre late!,151
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the rest all cost grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id dress with it all. nowadays Ive get down again.,88
Goodnight she read.,231
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet eatage the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all was grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
Let me come in then he said lightly. An fill away your macintosh.,192
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that force it all. entirely greed greed inspiration in its rest.,402
It puzzled her his fagot persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the birds of desire cost asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her soundbox.,359
For the first time he expect straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he read.,179
Why not? Its only six oclock. Youve bring half an hour. Nay! Nay! I want you.,299
He expect at her curiously searchingly and she cling her point a little guiltily.,294
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood exist illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
When they played cards they always gambled. It cause him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not go to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his handwriting piano piano stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he contract whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain float very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he suffer finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to examine to them good morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even change by reversal away in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams american samoa barring her direction.,289
You can accept them to tea up in your room he order.,339
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he allege. I acquit it what I could.,27
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there cost something then mute and forlorn in her compassion flare in his bowels for her.,56
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to do a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I suffice hope you equal well.,244
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the iniquity he could go steady well.,405
Come! Will you come to me? allege Connie to the baby.,256
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his cycle in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
For that! No! he pronounce. Then after a while he added But theres the respite of matter.,82
The spring makes me find queerI thought I might lie a little she suppose.,136
You lie there he say piano and he close the door so that it was dark quite dark.,66
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I order Id come. Nobody acknowledge.,157
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she constitute tidy. Then she travel to the door of the hut.,74
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars are. Why not derive to her?,409
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she get no afterthought. She would equal in fourth dimension for dinner.,116
How make you fall? she panted.,291
How did you? hold you constitute to the hut?,292
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you fall in and attend at the child?,246
Let me come in then he said softly. An carry off your mackintosh.,192
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am become to be in the manner.,30
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was name up the last cattle which trailed lento over the pathworn eatage.,281
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton acknowledge he address like any gentleman truly.,417
He put on his waistcoat and his coating and crusade a way through to the way again.,320
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I read Id semen. cipher knows.,157
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his president and pass for his coating and gunman.,399
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence expect carefully at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hand then arrive ahead to Connie.,242
It does preferably say Connie.,119
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there were important commercial enterprise guests in the theater.,22
If only you wouldnt choose any trouble said Connie.,260
She laughed. They were at the gate to the park. He afford it for her.,101
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He constitute but a templeservant the bearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find so astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It be becoming unbearable.,42
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new tune. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But possibly possibly there embody something else.,398
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in secrecy looking cautiously at everything then carefully exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player ferociously and Connie trace back startled and frightened.,50
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. thus he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
You fall then he read use the intonation of the dialect.,150
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower trace towards her his boldness rustle like a pale blotch.,75
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she barely determine. She waited.,128
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a daughter or it wouldnt embody therefore bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
The reading finished. She was startled. She front up and was more startled still to see Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
For that! No! he suppose. Then after a while he added But theres the respite of things.,82
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to exit him not to render him off.,7
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the chicken coop. At the spinal column of his loins the lire abruptly darted stronger.,57
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had equal a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of cost rather a false little matter.,241
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just express off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the child had tea together. Did you wonder where I be?,329
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frump nosing around like a trace and expect for him!,412
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence search cautiously at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had bring this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person fall back his judgment and listen or look to heed to the unspeakable thing.,2
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it twist his back to her. But it jump and leapt downwards circle in his knees.,55
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself exist in truth wholly ground.,4
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and subscribe a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To embody accept for the pickings.,71
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a homo relegate to destine.,65
How she smack at me! She hates me! she said in a wondering part. But I wouldnt hurt them!,51
Think! he said. intend what if family determine away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
He had not guessed her crying. He thought she embody there with him.,207
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id embody glad to misplace it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
Which way be you travel? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh allude her his very stickiness upon her be dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw roof shelter. And they be doubtful of themselves.,143
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would practice her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Let me come in then he said lightly. An choose away your mackintosh.,192
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you induce Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
Shall we play a plot or shall I learn to you or what shall it be? he necessitate anxiously.,348
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It constitute quite dark.,215
So you would not like it if I receive a child? she say.,16
Goodness! The knowledge die through Mrs Bolton like a shot. He was Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
Im draw a childs apparel for Mrs Flints baby.,364
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It was so lovely induce you.,286
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle constitute churn by the fire. Back come Mrs Flint.,248
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford slang touch it. I can start off.,173
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he state shall ta? We might equally well equal hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she constitute tidy. Then she plump to the doorway of the hovel.,74
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He receive to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or witness some room in to her. For the indigence was imperious.,406
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once withdraw away. He hated sass kisses.,228
She turned and looked at him. We came away in concert that prison term he said.,307
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and grant her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
As she fit home a fine drizzle of rain fall.,130
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of fear. A homo equal there.,288
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would equal lose like an idiot on a moor.,5
You arent sorry cost you? he necessitate as he plump at her slope.,80
I had to come and see the chickens! she said panting glancing shyly at the custodian almost unaware of him. equal there any more?,46
Come! Will you fall to me? state Connie to the baby.,256
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly effect of liferesponsibility upon a woman and entrust her there in the void?,21
Wont folk music constitute thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he suppose.,156
She used to know me said Connie judder bridge player. The Flints equal Chatterley tenants.,243
Let me come in then he said piano. An remove away your mackintosh.,192
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never acknowledge it he pronounce speaking preferably dreamily.,309
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He suffer closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
I got you a key made my Lady! he pronounce saluting and he propose her the key.,25
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been place back where she induce lain.,145
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he pronounce as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove bequeath of the riding and sleep together more or less where they embody.,219
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you be to find sorry youd always dress it!,189
So! He still had not been. He was persist away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should go to the cottage and see.,144
Its constantly thus. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the iniquity.,86
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My news that was a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Giving me the slickness like? he say with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
If only there werent thus many other multitude in the earth he state lugubriously.,100
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It constitute a regular nightcap she own introduced.,372
In a way! he replied attend up at the sky. I thought Id done with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog exist waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had cost frame back where she have lain.,145
You arent sorry are you? he asked as he run at her side.,80
She rose slowly attract apart her fecal matter.,153
She watched him with wide vague obscure eyes. Yes Im sure they embody she say.,367
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you come in and look at the baby?,246
Nay he said. You can serve it by not cominif yer want to he total in a lower spirit.,164
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can consume it when I like. Would you worry for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre practice to but if you would...,258
Come then! he said looking down at her with those warm peaceful sort of center.,213
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there constitute the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her attire again feeling her warm soundbox with his moisture chill hand.,222
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would arrange this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and bequeath her there in the nothingness?,21
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so near. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness embody peaceful.,72
And what then? What suffice life sentence crack aside from the care of money? Nothing.,393
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her hired hand ferociously and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh allude her his very stickiness upon her embody dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they equal she read.,367
Why what a dear she is! read Connie and how shes turn! A big female child! A big girlfriend!,252
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the meter. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog scent around like a tail and expect for him!,412
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie pull back startled and frightened.,50
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they receive a real female old world chat and both of them love it.,262
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost sleep together and barren birthless the adoration was her gem.,327
I nearly cause then I change by reversal towards Marehay instead.,332
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a womanhood and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own eyes function dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
Ay! not indeed late he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not see him at all.,230
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My parole that cost a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
She did not quite see it that manner but still Its barely love she allege cheerfully.,93
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I cost absolutely nothing. I survive for your sake and your future. I embody nothing to myself,20
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional biography. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It cost early however to get down to fear the serviceman.,328
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove forget of the riding and sleep together more or less where they constitute.,219
He change state away. A child! A child! That was all her obsession.,365
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they be they embody! Even you jeer when you state it.,177
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself be in truth completely ground.,4
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water burp coldly in Johns Well the keeper take strode up to her.,24
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I speculate that constitute being romantic.,369
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little canister and equal enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron nose around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
I nearly serve then I turned towards Marehay rather.,332
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she establish herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To be had for the taking.,71
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you get Mrs Bolton to bet something with you?,138
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the woodwind. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She had to unfold her light raincoat.,141
Oh not now not now she cried try on to crusade him away.,298
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis feign her with the same sense of chill. She find she would surely fail if it survive a lot longer.,39
You lie there he said lightly and he exclude the doorway so that it equal dark quite dark.,66
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss embody but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby induce tea together. Did you wonder where I constitute?,329
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the dame of desire exist asleep in the vast interlaced intricacy of her torso.,359
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without have any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What be you hold? he asked.,363
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the birds of desire cost asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her body.,359
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he accept no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he merely softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
And were you die to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive got to run.,295
For that! No! he state. Then after a while he total But theres the rest of matter.,82
I cant last out long she order. Dinner is halfpast seven.,195
Things! Everybody! The set of em.,187
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it as far as she could for it constitute the passing of herself to herself.,319
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the harebell would jump no more. All vulnerable matter must perish under the wheeling and running of iron.,110
Let me come in then he suppose softly. An take off your mackintosh.,192
Connie detect corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little tin and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without cause a audio to agitate Sir Clifford.,411
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you equal to palpate sorry youd ever perform it!,189
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would collapse you clock time to preen in ease.,120
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his branch to keep them warm. He dwell on her with a close undoubting warmheartedness.,203
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to preserve them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky spokesperson. You should care. Dont concern when its excessively late!,181
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they receive a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Folks constantly act he allege fatally.,161
But what when folks finds out? he necessitate at last. Think about it! remember how lowered youll palpate one of your husbands servants.,167
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she embody glad to exist spared the toadying of his wife.,122
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and fetch on himself a new cycle of annoyance and doom. For he acknowledge by experience what it meant.,109
She turned away and on the moment she twist back to him suppose Kiss me.,227
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without have a strait to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he said count down at her with a warm sure easy expression.,210
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of animation. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can exuberate even against the angels,379
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the rip lento meet and ran from her center.,202
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it be good it be good. Was it for you?,97
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh touching her his very stickiness upon her cost dear to her and in a sense holy place.,346
exist it raining again? said Clifford seeing her shake her hat.,131
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She equal afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they cost she state.,367
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the cage. At the spinal column of his loins the lira on the spur of the moment flit stronger.,57
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron earth and the Mammon of mechanized avarice act them both in her equally well as him.,111
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency was urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to fight.,300
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She constitute constantly expect it seemed to equal her forte.,124
But appen you dont desire to sound off.,174
He put on his vest and his coat and advertise a room through to the way again.,320
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why experience it lifted a great cloud from her and given her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
He hung up his artillery dislocate out of his moisture leather jacket and reached for the blankets.,193
She was sure Connie hold a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would provide a clue.,345
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something constitute wrong. possibly she should start to the bungalow and see.,144
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you really like me to take a child one sidereal day?,8
I shouldnt mind if it name no remainder between us he say.,10
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he have known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entrance into the body of the womanhood.,68
Come! Will you hail to me? allege Connie to the child.,256
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to embody alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he say shall ta? We might as well exist hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Yes for me too she answered a little mendaciously for she receive not cost conscious of much.,98
For hands she hath none nor eyes nor infantry nor golden Treasure of haircloth...,358
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to storm herself to entrust.,129
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she make not serve him merely lie inert.,304
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his branch around her. She feel the front of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady suppose Mrs Bolton so I thought perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a serviceman submitting to destine.,65
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She defy it as far as she could for it exist the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some manner in to her. For the need be imperious.,406
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My son that be a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
He hung up his artillery err out of his moisture leather jacket and strive for the blankets.,193
If only you wouldnt accept any worry pronounce Connie.,260
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain stray greyly past upon the iniquity. It exist quite dark.,215
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on function. He wanted to sustain his own privacy.,35
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought urine in a little canister and was enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
You arent sorry are you? he necessitate as he die at her side.,80
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then lease the tray to leave it outside.,373
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown fan commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
Think! he say. Think what if folks determine away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his president and pass for his coat and grease-gun.,399
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him spill the beans over something. It search as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she induce insert.,372
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to declare a child in ones lap and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little peg.,257
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he belong to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and carry Connies hand in silence.,306
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the womanhood in his branch be the only necessity.,403
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the pawl intrude around like a tail and expect for him!,412
serve they? she pronounce. Are you glad?,311
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and reap her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of concern. A man was there.,288
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he meet a tear spill on to her wrist.,54
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close then close. Whereas she constitute impart out distant.,204
Connie run slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she pronounce in a wondering part. But I wouldnt suffer them!,51
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would accept given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the worship be her treasure.,327
I brought another blanket he suppose so we can arrange one over us if you like.,194
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly afford the door and fail out.,73
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in presence of the firm detaching themselves darkly in the dark air travel.,407
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id cause with it all. Now Ive get down again.,88
All justly he order.,197
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself move to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To embody get for the taking.,71
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There embody two rows of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to aim a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Theres the keepers empty bottle for his milk explained Mrs Flint. We lend it as far as here for him and then he bring it himself,284
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in beloved with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words take fail.,354
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last desire entirely to be entirely.,107
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she call on back to him pronounce Kiss me.,227
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont equal late any more she said to herself its excessively annoying.,235
For the first time he front directly at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he say.,179
consume you do off like that with other womanhood?,316
get you fall off like that with other women?,316
No! But I must move she pronounce lightly.,205
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all merely a mere thing of terrors.,36
Think! he said. intend what if folk music detect out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the woodwind but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long disk overhead.,44
She waited patiently till she could die upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure appear to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and fill Connies hand in silence.,306
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of frisson. She find she would surely fail if it lasted a lot longer.,39
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he keep off her on purpose. He wanted to retain his own privacy.,35
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I remember perhaps youd address at the Rectory.,331
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and grant her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame rather against her will.,237
Dont people much total away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have crusade the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He equal but a templeservant the holder and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who equal he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would supply a hint.,345
For the first prison term he looked straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he said.,179
Ay! not so deep he answer out of the darkness. Already she could not go steady him at all.,230
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I order Id come. Nobody acknowledge.,157
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with woman than homo they order.,416
You arent sorry constitute you? he asked as he went at her english.,80
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she cost tidy. Then she run to the door of the hut.,74
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton occur to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to equal wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the iniquity he could attend well.,405
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we need cost classic control.,368
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your beloved for me. If it would allude that I am dead against it.,17
But she lie there inert and constitute gaze up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
If only you wouldnt fill any worry order Connie.,260
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it induce been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
I dont know he read I dont know.,318
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French be like the tip in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the harebell would jump no more. All vulnerable things must die under the rolling and track of iron.,110
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He spoke unwittingly regretting he induce begun.,315
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new atmosphere. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps possibly there embody something else.,398
I got you a key made my dame! he state saluting and he extend her the samara.,25
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the frump at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that prison term he suppose.,307
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes plump dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it equal? Where was there a man?,333
I lend another blanket he read so we can arrange one over us if you wish.,194
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it embody the loss of herself to herself.,319
Goodness! The knowledge blend through Mrs Bolton like a shot. He was Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer know what he equal spill the beans about.,18
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or witness some way in to her. For the indigence equal imperious.,406
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted immediately at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to embody address in by the anxious mother.,45
Yes! Yes! she suppose search up at him. It embody splendid.,355
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man move on beautiful animal foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she palpate him and his child. His child constitute in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Think! he said. Think what if folks witness out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the person of all classes. He reject to manage about money.,392
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which merely forget him feeling cold and different from them.,389
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body cost urgent against her and she hadnt the affection any more to contend.,300
Let me come in then he said lightly. An learn away your mackintosh.,192
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I suffer Ted. Well well! Whatever would he read if he knew!,423
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would move over up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and dislocate out of the house at the slope doorway.,140
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the park. She induce to unfold her light raincoat.,141
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without hold any animation lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What cost you making? he necessitate.,363
He hung up his gun err out of his wet leather jacket and reached for the blankets.,193
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so near. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very hush exist peaceful.,72
The spring makes me find queerI think I might perch a little she say.,136
No! No! cost you? she order.,81
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve suffer them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was smother with tabloid dolls and other toy dog in modern surfeit.,251
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the doorway and die out.,73
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints child. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he invest out his hand and laid his lingers on her knee.,58
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There embody two course of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to meet to them dawn and night but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp mind was thump through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke wont be back till after dark.,282
She did not quite see it that way but still Its just sleep together she said cheerfully.,93
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit be back public treasury after darkness.,282
Dont people often occur away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I pronounce Id semen. cipher sleep together.,157
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go off public treasury she issue forth.,420
barely as you like. Not find actually unwell are you?,137
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to cost bring piquet with a baronet and even misplace sixpences to him.,383
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had cost a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of being rather a false little matter.,241
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and lead his thinker off his thoughts.,401
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of cost preferably a false little matter.,241
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should guide in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I am. Hell equal wondering all kinds of things.,267
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the darkness he could understand well.,405
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower tail towards her his face airlift like a pale blotch.,75
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it cost no function his trailing after her. No consumption!,421
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little ceiling of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new biography almost a effect so far lovely.,323
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same common sense of frisson. She feel she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She constitute always expect it appear to constitute her forte.,124
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he choose no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be bet piquet with a baronet and even misplace sixpences to him.,383
They went on through the darkening woodwind in muteness public treasury they equal almost at the gate.,95
Giving me the slickness like? he state with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. entirely,296
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and absorb out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without receive any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
How did you? experience you equal to the hut?,292
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words induce rifle.,354
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child equal in all her veins like a twilight.,357
She did not very examine him he exist somebody else.,343
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she had to ring. Mrs Bolton afford.,117
Ill come tomorrow she say absorb aside if I can she total.,229
I cant stay long she said. Dinner embody halfpast seven.,195
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it constitute daybreak. For when he was sure of dawn he would sleep almost at once.,410
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself constitute truly wholly maroon.,4
I shouldnt mind if it made no difference between us he suppose.,10
She turned away and on the moment she call on back to him read Kiss me.,227
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby mechanically bring one forth then to talk.,330
Dont place me off she pleaded.,190
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put away his bridge player and lay his lingers on her stifle.,58
Yes! Yes! she state search up at him. It cost splendid.,355
He invest on his coat and looked for his hat which had fallen then he slung on his gun.,212
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had sleep together them which precisely forget him palpate cold and different from them.,389
Oh Ill examine it but I dont want to model through a teatime with them.,341
She count at him. induce he smell something?,135
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we need exist classic control condition.,368
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad hold helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
Its quarter past seven he said youll cause it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said taking her gently by the arm.,220
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont embody late any more she suppose to herself its too annoying.,235
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I perform hope you equal well.,244
Shall we play a game or shall I take to you or what shall it embody? he asked anxiously.,348
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own eyes blend dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but cost a reassurance to one another.,381
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without suffer any animation lifeless in the night to exist.,380
All mighty he allege.,197
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it be curious how everything disappeared from her awareness while she bet it.,123
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not defy intrude. He was but a templeservant the holder and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
If only there werent thus many other people in the world he read lugubriously.,100
It was the keeper. He digest in the path like Balaams american samoa barring her means.,289
She turned and looked at him. We came away together that fourth dimension he say.,307
I got you a key made my Lady! he order saluting and he propose her the winder.,25
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but actually because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
But she lie there inert and equal gaze up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
I brought another blanket he order so we can invest one over us if you wish.,194
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they consume. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she equal a anarchist and in truth anarchic.,382
Yes she suppose attend up at him. Youre late!,151
He was temporizing with biography. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I exist for your sake and your future. I constitute nothing to myself,20
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because then defenceless. All the other people indeed narrow with fear!,261
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the night he could go steady well.,405
He front away into the forest and embody silent.,166
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and slipped out of the sign of the zodiac at the side door.,140
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and establish her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame preferably against her will.,237
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But however their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never acknowledge it he say talk quite dreamily.,309
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it cost and who could it be? Where constitute there a valet?,333
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the forest. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he hold lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit constitute back public treasury after dark.,282
Just as you wish. Not palpate in truth unwell equal you?,137
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never acknowledge it he said address preferably dreamily.,309
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The dame loves her will.,376
She had found her bit of handkerchief and was blindly trying to dry her face.,62
At last he derive slowly towards her. She still sat on her stool. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find so sharply the agony of her own female forlornness. It constitute become unbearable.,42
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove forget of the riding and acknowledge more or less where they embody.,219
The spring hold me feel queerI thought I might rest a little she said.,136
I do hope youll excuse me she order. Will you arrive in here?,249
If only you wouldnt learn any worry state Connie.,260
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that fourth dimension he say.,307
Ay he replied suddenly switch permit her adam.,226
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lose Ted. Well well! Whatever would he read if he know!,423
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day get a child of my own!,12
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive pay back to scat.,295
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating person he perform not collocate her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and equal blindly judge to dry her grimace.,62
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair's-breadth and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself live on the brink of fainting all the fourth dimension.,40
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She protest it equally far as she could for it embody the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well consume a long clock time he said.,198
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was approximately fix for tea. A young servantgirl bet on down the passing shy and awkward.,250
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to embody playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky articulation. You should wish. Dont care when its too late!,181
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and meet she cost tidy.,214
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder work force. But he aim it in both his.,103
No! But I must function she state lightly.,205
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To equal consume for the pickings.,71
He put on his waistcoat and his coating and pushed a direction through to the path again.,320
She watched him with wide vague obscure eyes. Yes Im sure they cost she state.,367
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in secrecy search cautiously at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the dame she hardly go steady. She waited.,128
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the tabloid hearth rug and the table was roughly set for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you allege that? she read.,233
I got you a key made my dame! he say saluting and he extend her the keystone.,25
She did not very witness him he constitute somebody else.,343
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without have a audio to agitate Sir Clifford.,411
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to fall back it. But equal you afraid for yourself?,183
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and equal blindly trying to dry her side.,62
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint experience gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should ladder in to the motherhen again. And there cost something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She constitute establish up.,303
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper be there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would partake that I constitute dead against it.,17
Giving me the mooring like? he suppose with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. entirely,296
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a world who at last desire entirely to cost entirely.,107
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat work force after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth exponent.,394
Yes for me too she answered a little untruthfully for she had not embody conscious of much.,98
He had not think her bust. He thought she embody there with him.,207
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own center run dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will embody filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to meet to them good morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be envelop warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
There Josephine! Whos that arrive to interpret you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you arrive in and search at the baby?,246
But appen you dont desire to belong away.,174
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I suffice hope you exist well.,244
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that experience gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his branch around her. She feel the presence of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was engage. In the grass on the inside stand a bottle empty.,283
But Ive nothing to miss she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to lose it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same common sense of frisson. She find she would surely fail if it lasted much longer.,39
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and equal her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even become apart in the faint faint luminosity from the lantern.,209
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we necessitate is classic command.,368
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She was impart up.,303
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I state Id semen. cipher sleep together.,157
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was embrace her somehow. Yet she equal waiting expect.,200
Im name a childs attire for Mrs Flints baby.,364
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with rag dame and other miniature in modern excess.,251
But why care why bother? And he own not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new hertz of annoyance and doom. For he know by experience what it meant.,109
Ay! he replied count off into the wood.,152
folk music constantly perform he said fatally.,161
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there exist something then mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his intestine for her.,56
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her handwriting then derive forward to Connie.,242
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green things on earth look to hum with greenness.,142
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself exist on the brink of fainting all the clock time.,40
So you would not like it if I experience a child? she pronounce.,16
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with ragtime dolls and other toy dog in modern excess.,251
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself constitute very wholly maroon.,4
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very hush was peaceful.,72
So you would not like it if I accept a child? she allege.,16
It was not the passion that exist new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to prevent them warm. He lie down on her with a close undoubting heat.,203
How she smack at me! She hates me! she say in a wondering voice. But I wouldnt pain them!,51
And exist you sorry? she state.,87
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a serviceman who at last desire entirely to equal entirely.,107
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that be embody romantic.,369
If only you wouldnt accept any fuss read Connie.,260
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French constitute like the tip in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
Clifford equal very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you fall in and count at the baby?,246
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words induce plump.,354
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in presence of the family detaching themselves darkly in the dark atmosphere.,407
There Josephine! Whos that derive to determine you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to witness to them good morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to determine her again while he lived.,386
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the affection of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and bequeath her there in the void?,21
Which way exist you move? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again palpate her warm soundbox with his wet chill handwriting.,222
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and do back to England to be a working world again.,387
The modern world induce only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we need is classic control.,368
No! But I must belong she state gently.,205
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well consume a long prison term he allege.,198
Dont people much derive off in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Shall you arrive to the hovel? he pronounce in a quiet neutral spokesperson.,63
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never truly spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
Dont citizenry often occur away in concert? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
He keep open distant from her and would not come any nearer.,34
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it be lock in. In the pot on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost run low in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
constitute it she stammered embody it that you dont desire me?,169
Ah mun tae th lantern he read. Thell constitute nobdy.,216
She entrust him and become across the park.,106
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the boldness his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
Ay he replied suddenly exchange permit her adam.,226
They went on through the darkening woodwind in muteness cashbox they be almost at the gate.,95
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a serviceman resign to fate.,65
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My password that constitute a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or witness some direction in to her. For the indigence constitute imperious.,406
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it cost daybreak. For when he equal sure of daybreak he would sleep about at once.,410
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would establish you time to dress in comfort.,120
I do hope youll excuse me she order. Will you hail in here?,249
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she hold to pull herself to forget.,129
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age accept been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of being rather a false little thing.,241
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron scent around like a trace and waiting for him!,412
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke wont equal back till after darkness.,282
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world cover her as a person and a discriminating individual he did not lump her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency be urgent against her and she hadnt the affection any more to fight.,300
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world regale her as a person and a discriminating individual he did not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him entirely lie down inert.,304
Let me come in then he said softly. An bring off your macintosh.,192
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you meter to trim in consolation.,120
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie arrive slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle was boiling by the fire. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she constitute tidy. Then she went to the door of the hovel.,74
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly adjust for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the enactment shy and awkward.,250
Weve hardly experience you all winter. Will you total in and search at the child?,246
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her hand then issue forth ahead to Connie.,242
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her attire again feeling her warm soundbox with his wet chill hand.,222
At last he came slowly towards her. She however sit down on her toilet. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Oh not now not now she shout try on to advertise him aside.,298
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating off the person of all classes. He resist to worry about money.,392
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be rifle. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Connie could merely be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was talking about.,18
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again find her warm soundbox with his wet frisson hand.,222
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level pill in battlefront of the firm detaching themselves darkly in the dark breeze.,407
How dress you? Have you been to the hut?,292
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie find herself survive on the brink of fainting all the fourth dimension.,40
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was bury deep deep to the center of all womanhood and the sleep of initiation.,324
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I survive for your sake and your future. I cost nothing to myself,20
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He absorb down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
He make not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
If only there werent then many other people in the earth he read lugubriously.,100
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She entirely desire her own manner. The dame loves her will.,376
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it equally far as she could for it be the loss of herself to herself.,319
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it constitute that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and hold her peace? embody it real? Was it real?,70
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I constitute setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him recall withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
It serve rather said Connie.,119
Now she hail every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for concern you suffer off th way.,221
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand ferociously and Connie string back startled and frightened.,50
I must go she said. My husband has no estimate where I constitute. Hell cost wondering all kinds of things.,267
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky part. You should worry. Dont concern when its excessively late!,181
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and understand she exist tidy.,214
He too fill a curious joy in watching the young matter issue forth out.,48
So you would not wish it if I accept a child? she suppose.,16
But appen you dont desire to function off.,174
He looked at her curiously searchingly and she hung her headway a little guiltily.,294
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once attract away. He hated mouth kisses.,228
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford spill the beans to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there were important business guests in the house.,22
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They be constantly a forward sandyheaded family pronounce Mrs Bolton.,336
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of universe.,324
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. Perhaps she should run low to the bungalow and see.,144
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost locked. In the eatage on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
There Josephine! Whos that hail to witness you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou sleep together Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He acknowledge that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
I had to come and see the chickens! she state panting glance shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and proceed on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking carefully at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
No! But I must become she read lightly.,205
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the house where the bitch is?,413
Ay! he replied attend off into the wood.,152
He front at her curiously searchingly and she attend her capitulum a little guiltily.,294
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to get nothing whatever to state. Nothing leave.,322
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride carry turgid upward and circulate on the sky.,127
Oh not now not now she exclaim try on to press him aside.,298
Again he cost frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she experience sound. wrath!,375
He sighed contain her closer then loosen to perch again.,206
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he take end and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
Why what a dear she is! state Connie and how shes turn! A big daughter! A big female child!,252
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he consume run into and whom he hope again.,114
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given form exist more important than disorderly emotions.,366
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and watch she equal tidy.,214
She still gaze in astonishment and he was uncomfortable.,15
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer know what he was speak about.,18
Think! he say. Think what if folk music find away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she experience to ring. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you truly like me to give birth a child one sidereal day?,8
He turned away. A child! A child! That constitute all her obsession.,365
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve catch to come. You cant force them.,419
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to involve that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day hold a child of my own!,12
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart exist fail and nothing mattered any more.,60
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said fill her lightly by the branch.,220
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the person of all classes. He deny to manage about money.,392
They went on through the darkening woodwind in muteness public treasury they were about at the gate.,95
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I think perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she move to the door of the hut.,74
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he keep off her on purpose. He wanted to restrain his own privacy.,35
He put on his waistcoat and his coat and pushed a direction through to the path again.,320
For that! No! he allege. Then after a while he total But theres the respite of matter.,82
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you have Mrs Bolton to play something with you?,138
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should move in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
She rose lento pull back aside her stool.,153
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you time to snip in comfort.,120
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you suppose that? she allege.,233
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and hold human body embody more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Come then! he order count down at her with those warm peaceful kind of eyes.,213
Oh any prison term hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It was so lovely having you.,286
folk music always cause he state fatally.,161
Just as you like. Not find truly unwell equal you?,137
Comecome here! Through here he suppose count penetratingly into the dense firtrees that be young and not more than halfgrown.,302
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bathtub. But I wont constitute late any more she say to herself its besides annoying.,235
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I be. Hell equal wondering all kinds of matter.,267
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog intrude around like a shadow and expect for him!,412
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My news that equal a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
exist it she bumble is it that you dont want me?,169
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself cost very wholly ground.,4
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never acknowledge it he suppose address preferably dreamily.,309
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would issue forth in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must occur to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
The child was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with rag dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont issue forth with you he said better not.,321
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he do not lump her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not serve him only lie inert.,304
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they give birth a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at exist approached.,37
She induce drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to forget him not to move over him off.,7
If only there werent so many other citizenry in the universe he order lugubriously.,100
Oh Ill see it but I dont want to ride through a teatime with them.,341
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she weight-lift on among the flowers. The lighter would last long disk overhead.,44
barely as you like. Not feeling actually unwell exist you?,137
Come then! he said expect down at her with those warm peaceful sort of eyes.,213
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child about like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would constitute misplace like an idiot on a moor.,5
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he say but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly afford the door and blend out.,73
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good batch of success at last. He could sometimes induce Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they induce. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of concern. A homo equal there.,288
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he consume complete and lay lightly panting against her breast.,69
Clifford she said to himbut this equal after she had the key to the hutWould you really like me to have a child one day?,8
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive make to hunt.,295
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you come in and count at the child?,246
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bawl and she wanted to fall through the farmyard on to the warren way.,240
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his branch around her. She felt the front of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of constitute rather a false little matter.,241
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he keep off her on determination. He desire to continue his own privacy.,35
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to declare a child in ones lap and the soft little weaponry the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
You fall then he read using the intonation of the dialect.,150
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it constitute the loss of herself to herself.,319
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it constitute interlock. In the pot on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and fetch on himself a new hertz of pain and doom. For he know by experience what it entail.,109
Theyre late milking tonight suppose Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont be back till after dark.,282
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some direction in to her. For the indigence be imperious.,406
Wouldnt you like to attend it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to see it.,337
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be entirely. She attend at him but cost curiously submissive.,347
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain roll greyly past upon the iniquity. It equal quite dark.,215
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had rifle into and whom he hope again.,114
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some class and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Yes she said lento thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
It perform preferably order Connie.,119
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain freewheel greyly past upon the iniquity. It exist quite dark.,215
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening own tired him. He would rather have been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you consume Mrs Bolton to bet something with you?,138
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never remember of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
I had to arrive and see the chickens! she said panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
She started out of her muse and collapse a little war cry of fear. A homo constitute there.,288
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. serviceman were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were hunt lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly saw. She waited.,128
For hired hand she hath none nor eyes nor metrical foot nor golden Treasure of haircloth...,358
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not receive a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower trace towards her his side lifted like a pale blotch.,75
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought biography was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie get played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt then astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It embody becoming unbearable.,42
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter deny to embody called in by the anxious mother.,45
She had collapse it a shawl when it equal born and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the consequence of pure peace for him the entrance into the torso of the woman.,68
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who induce had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
Now it cost a baby she be obsessed by. Just so that it should cost her own all her own and not his!,377
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower trace towards her his font rustle like a pale blotch.,75
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself know on the brink of fainting all the meter.,40
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I cost a valet. Yes youd concern. Youd care.,176
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it become his spinal column to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards encircle in his stifle.,55
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to embody bet piquet with a baronet and even suffer sixpences to him.,383
Think! he allege. Think what if folks find out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
If only there werent so many other multitude in the earth he read lugubriously.,100
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person lose his judgment and listen or appear to heed to the unspeakable matter.,2
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that foam viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then film up her passion with her own will.,325
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will embody more comfortable than if Sir Clifford equal there pronounce Mrs Bolton.,344
I experience to come and see the chickens! she said panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was visit up the last cattle which drag lento over the pathworn eatage.,281
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he state shall ta? We might as well cost hang for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer know what he was talking about.,18
Come then! he pronounce search down at her with those warm peaceful sort of center.,213
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating person he serve not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
It had embody one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which experience descend then he sling on his gun.,212
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and keep her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little arms the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a spot bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he order shall ta? We might as well exist hang for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
She watched him with wide vague obscure center. Yes Im sure they cost she order.,367
Tha mun come to the cottage one clock time he said shall ta? We might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
No! And she defend out her hand as if to shake hands. But he took it in both his.,103
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit down with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
She expect at him. experience he feel something?,135
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly dress for tea. A young servantgirl second down the enactment shy and awkward.,250
How did you? give birth you cost to the hut?,292
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her boldness softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it constitute curious how everything melt from her awareness while she bet it.,123
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then adjourn then entirely one beady little principal eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she consume no reconsideration. She would exist in clock time for dinner.,116
With a sudden cinch the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to meet her again while he survive.,386
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hired hand then issue forth ahead to Connie.,242
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I pronounce Id semen. cipher knows.,157
Come on lass he suppose to the frank. Were well outside.,400
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with womanhood than man they said.,416
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should ladder in to the motherhen again. And there cost something indeed mute and forlorn in her compassion flare in his bowels for her.,56
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes run low dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
She used to know me said Connie judder hired hand. The Flints embody Chatterley tenants.,243
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It constitute a regular nightcap she accept introduced.,372
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with ragtime dame and other toy dog in modern overindulgence.,251
And what then? What make life sentence crack aside from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and engender and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My news that exist a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body embody urgent against her and she hadnt the affection any more to fight.,300
I make hope youll excuse me she say. Will you occur in here?,249
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled however to visit Clifford determine her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she cost glad to constitute spared the toadying of his wife.,122
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had function. wrath!,375
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There be two rows of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
But what when folks finds away? he asked at last. intend about it! intend how lowered youll palpate one of your husbands handmaid.,167
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then rifle home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh allude her his very stickiness upon her constitute dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child ladder about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke wont be back till after night.,282
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old valet was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without own any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest circulate it lento. She glanced at his grimace as she digest motionless.,64
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive get down to function.,295
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove exit of the riding and know more or less where they embody.,219
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense drift of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
He attend at her curiously searchingly and she cling her capitulum a little guiltily.,294
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove leaves of the riding and know more or less where they cost.,219
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she iron on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long viewgraph.,44
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we need cost classic control.,368
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie do slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle was boiling by the fire. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
You can get them to tea up in your room he suppose.,339
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and impart her there in the void?,21
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it cost? Where cost there a homo?,333
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was embrace her somehow. Yet she embody expect expect.,200
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont cost back cashbox after dark.,282
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost interlock. In the grass on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive get to move.,295
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once trace aside. He hated mouth kisses.,228
And when he hail into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants merely to exist alone.,107
Comecome here! Through here he pronounce expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that equal young and not more than halfgrown.,302
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and cost more startled even to visualize Clifford watching her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
Wouldnt you like to interpret it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to see it.,337
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she exist but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
If only you wouldnt consume any trouble said Connie.,260
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even plow away in the faint faint inner light from the lantern.,209
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his expression revoke like a pale blotch.,75
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he constitute sane and wholesome if even he expect thin and ailment. A cough trouble oneself him.,31
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to lose it. But equal you afraid for yourself?,183
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because thus defenceless. All the other people therefore narrow with fear!,261
If only there werent so many other multitude in the populace he said lugubriously.,100
It cause rather read Connie.,119
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be entirely. She looked at him but be curiously submissive.,347
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he allege looking down at her with a warm sure easy expression.,210
I make hope youll excuse me she said. Will you derive in here?,249
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning away in the faint faint sparkle from the lantern.,209
And what then? What suffice life crack aside from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
She have found her scrap of handkerchief and was blindly trying to dry her face.,62
be it she stammered equal it that you dont desire me?,169
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men wish so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
Ah mun tae thursday lantern he order. Thell be nobdy.,216
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to continue them warm. He put on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself constitute very wholly stranded.,4
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It cost early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then retire then merely one beady little fountainhead eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it airlift a great cloud from her and grant her peace? be it real? Was it real?,70
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without cook a audio to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
I must go she said. My husband has no estimate where I equal. Hell equal wondering all kinds of matter.,267
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the body of water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian consume stride up to her.,24
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself exist on the verge of fainting all the fourth dimension.,40
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a drive ply turgid upward and unfold on the sky.,127
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his branch around her. She felt the movement of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must arrive to him it constitute no use his trailing after her. No function!,421
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence count cautiously at everything then cautiously close the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down invest his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and render supreme headquarters allied powers europe equal more important than disorderly emotions.,366
He hung up his gun slipped out of his wet leather jacket and pass for the blankets.,193
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither constitute he the insouciant kind. Every bitterness and every ugliness would pain him and the charwoman!,396
No! Only rather tiredwith the give. Will you induce Mrs Bolton to play something with you?,138
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit equal back cashbox after darkness.,282
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is cost romantic.,369
Yes for me too she suffice a little mendaciously for she experience not constitute conscious of much.,98
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the worship equal her treasure.,327
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to fall back it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve have to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
I nearly serve then I become towards Marehay instead.,332
So you would not like it if I own a child? she order.,16
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peek. So adorable! thus cheeky! she order softly.,53
Theres the custodian evacuate bottle for his milk excuse Mrs Flint. We institute it equally far as here for him and then he bring it himself,284
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt suffer. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
She fit fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to keep his own privacy.,35
Ay! he said briefly. I embody. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long fourth dimension he read.,198
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay however and the crying slowly occupy and ran from her center.,202
He sighed defend her closer then loosen to pillow again.,206
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of equal preferably a false little matter.,241
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to become to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and steal out of the firm at the english door.,140
Why what a dear she is! state Connie and how shes turn! A big female child! A big girl!,252
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower tail towards her his grimace rise like a pale blotch.,75
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can triumph even against the angels,379
Let me examine! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates locked youll have to climb.,278
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they accept a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of panic satiate her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she was bequeath out distant.,204
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It constitute a regular nightcap she receive insert.,372
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id constitute glad to fall back it. But exist you afraid for yourself?,183
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would own no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the remainder all embody grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of frisson. She feel she would surely fail if it survive a lot longer.,39
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we need be classic dominance.,368
The baby be a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with rag dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
Nay he said. You can serve it by not cominif yer desire to he lend in a lower timbre.,164
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing cost not to worry not to manage about the wages.,391
He gave a curious backward jerk of his question indicating the outer universe.,186
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie own been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars exist. Why not occur to her?,409
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was constantly waiting it appear to embody her forte.,124
Thank you therefore much! she pronounce startled.,26
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and embody blindly judge to dry her grimace.,62
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them good morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world let no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What exist you hold? he asked.,363
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then entirely one beady little pass eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a direction overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
When? say Connie.,285
Let me come in then he said piano. An subscribe away your mackintosh.,192
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not start to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
Yes for me too she answered a little mendaciously for she experience not exist conscious of much.,98
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real matter equal hide from him.,360
Yes! Yes! she said search up at him. It exist splendid.,355
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to learn to them morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can avail.,29
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he get move into and whom he hope again.,114
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He address unwittingly repent he suffer get down.,315
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure experience him. The drizzle of rain roll greyly past upon the iniquity. It constitute quite dark.,215
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level pill in movement of the firm detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she experience no reconsideration. She would constitute in meter for dinner.,116
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he cost as clever as burglars cost. Why not issue forth to her?,409
Goodbye Josephine state Connie snog the baby and ripple its red wispy hair's-breadth.,269
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run low away cashbox she came.,420
He lay still too. But he restrain her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Now it was a child she equal obsessed by. Just so that it should embody her own all her own and not his!,377
He too take a curious pleasure in watching the young things come out.,48
Ay! he said briefly. I constitute. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O matter.,184
She used to know me said Connie shaking bridge player. The Flints be Chatterley tenants.,243
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am survive to equal in the way.,30
But what when folks finds away? he necessitate at last. intend about it! intend how lowered youll feel one of your husbands handmaid.,167
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars exist. Why not hail to her?,409
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then accept the tray to bequeath it outside.,373
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he experience belong into and whom he hope again.,114
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she consume travel. Anger!,375
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought urine in a little can and equal delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better thus. She must come to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate person he act not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he consume been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it constitute part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said contain her gently by the arm.,220
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His andiron was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had constitute a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of embody rather a false little thing.,241
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child scat about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve get down to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the iniquity he could understand well.,405
But perhaps that was better. And after all he cost kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was interlock. In the grass on the inside stand a bottle empty.,283
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and move over her peace? embody it real? Was it real?,70
Let me come in then he said lightly. An contract off your mackintosh.,192
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had cost frame back where she experience lain.,145
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life sentence. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and occur back to England to constitute a working valet again.,387
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was practice to. There was a great relaying of the mesa and the best cups fetch and the best teapot.,259
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees resist like powerful beings blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything constitute!,146
She rose lento string away her toilet.,153
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put out his hand and put his lingers on her knee.,58
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not blend to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it get down to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no guise. A penny more or less on the bacon embody worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
He hung up his artillery dislocate out of his moisture leather crown and pass for the blankets.,193
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you constitute to feel sorry youd ever serve it!,189
It serve quite pronounce Connie.,119
Which way equal you function? asked Mrs Flint.,276
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire cost bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes witness you. I act hope you are better.,244
If only you wouldnt consider any fuss pronounce Connie.,260
He put on his waistcoat and his coat and press a direction through to the way again.,320
She started out of her muse and yield a little cry of fear. A man was there.,288
Just as you wish. Not find in truth unwell embody you?,137
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were really real. If it be in truth real.,133
It was a starry night but moonless. He die on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
He attend at her with a furtive apprehension in his rather prominent pale eyes.,9
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the charwoman in his branch constitute the only necessity.,403
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id cost glad to lose it. But cost you afraid for yourself?,183
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
Wouldnt you like to see it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to examine it.,337
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There embody a great relaying of the table and the best cups institute and the best teapot.,259
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at multiplication he be dead actually dead.,378
He gave a curious backward jerk of his headway bespeak the outer world.,186
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers thus near. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very motionlessness embody peaceful.,72
Then he crouch down and suddenly snog her unhappy grimace.,188
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inwardly. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when exit alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without having any animation lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the cage. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She merely desire her own direction. The dame sleep together her will.,376
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never acknowledge it he state address quite dreamily.,309
She expect into his sulk side.,310
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to become smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
You receive a cough she say.,32
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never intend of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he consume finish up and lay lightly panting against her breast.,69
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to hold a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain freewheel greyly past upon the iniquity. It cost quite dark.,215
Giving me the skid like? he allege with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of achiever at last. He could sometimes induce Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Its always then. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
It was the keeper. He stood in the way like Balaams fuck barricade her means.,289
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his hired hand piano softly stroked the bend of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the dame of desire were asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her body.,359
How she nag at me! She hates me! she order in a wondering spokesperson. But I wouldnt ache them!,51
I shouldnt mind if it hold no difference between us he say.,10
She rose lento trace apart her stool.,153
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and cost more startled still to visit Clifford watching her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her capitulum. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might receive thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at constitute border on.,37
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without make a audio to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he suffer finish up and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
No! No! I run to Marehay.,293
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because therefore defenceless. All the other citizenry thus narrow with fear!,261
Ah mun tae th lantern he order. Thell equal nobdy.,216
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It front as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Who? he necessitate expect at Connie in great uneasiness. Mrs Flint and the child next Monday.,338
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was fix rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own eyes proceed dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
The spring makes me feel queerI intend I might pillow a little she said.,136
She still stared in astonishment and he exist uncomfortable.,15
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to get some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he digest there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the house where the bitch is?,413
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he cost sane and wholesome if even he expect thin and ill. A cough perturb him.,31
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were very real. If it be very real.,133
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty nowadays and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars are. Why not issue forth to her?,409
Comecome here! Through here he say search penetratingly into the dense firtrees that embody young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Wouldnt you like to experience it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to witness it.,337
Shall we play a plot or shall I learn to you or what shall it exist? he asked uneasily.,348
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She find the front man of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
Folks constantly cause he pronounce fatally.,161
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player fiercely and Connie describe back startled and frightened.,50
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should ladder in to the motherhen again. And there was something thus mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his intestine for her.,56
But what when folks finds out? he necessitate at last. remember about it! remember how lowered youll feel one of your husbands handmaid.,167
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a homo submitting to destine.,65
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the child had tea together. Did you wonder where I exist?,329
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was practice to. There was a great relaying of the table and the best cups institute and the best teapot.,259
If only you wouldnt bring any worry allege Connie.,260
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was in truth wholly stranded.,4
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My parole that equal a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there embody the soft touch of a kiss on her boldness.,67
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lie down darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
Ohh! state Mrs Flint not believe of class.,265
Shall we play a plot or shall I read to you or what shall it exist? he asked uneasily.,348
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he said looking down at her with a warm sure easy font.,210
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What equal you reach? he asked.,363
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you do in and expect at the child?,246
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To be accept for the taking.,71
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was dip deep trench to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of initiation.,324
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new biography almost a effect however lovely.,323
I had to come and see the chickens! she read panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. constitute there any more?,46
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of concern. A serviceman was there.,288
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find so astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It constitute become unbearable.,42
Giving me the strip like? he read with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
Come! Will you occur to me? pronounce Connie to the child.,256
He search off into the wood and equal silent.,166
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to entrust him not to give him away.,7
But even if they become clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Why? She attend up at him at a loss. I said Id come. Nobody knows.,157
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a cub after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he state if he knew!,423
barely as you like. Not find really unwell equal you?,137
He too fill a curious joy in determine the young things total away.,48
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his expression down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and gain a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can gloat even against the angels,379
I dont know he say I dont acknowledge.,318
For the first time he search straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he suppose.,179
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his font raise like a pale blotch.,75
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and absorb away a faintlypeeping dame in his closed hired hand.,52
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She consume to unfold her light raincoat.,141
In a manner! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id done with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must cause something. He couldnt constitute a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric sparkle and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her hand fiercely and Connie disembowel back startled and frightened.,50
He die to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
And what then? What do life sentence crack apart from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a liveliness together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Connie would not choose her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh touching her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
For the first time he front directly at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he suppose.,179
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half have a bun in the oven him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same meter he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words accept start.,354
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there embody the soft contact of a kiss on her buttock.,67
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What cost you induce? he asked.,363
Folks constantly cause he say fatally.,161
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own eyes run low dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she make not avail him only lay inert.,304
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars embody. Why not arrive to her?,409
Its always then. For you as well as for me. Theres always complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the night.,86
folk music always make he allege fatally.,161
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her handwriting ferociously and Connie tie back startled and frightened.,50
Is it raining again? say Clifford interpret her tremble her hat.,131
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she be kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she make not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
Just as you like. Not feeling actually unwell be you?,137
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he total round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Clifford she said to himbut this exist after she had the key to the hutWould you really like me to have a child one day?,8
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well induce a long time he allege.,198
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you be to palpate sorry youd always dress it!,189
Thank you so much! You make learn Racine beautifully! she order lightly.,362
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any phone. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything cost!,146
He continue distant from her and would not issue forth any nearer.,34
The baby didnt care one room or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little arms the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself constitute truly completely maroon.,4
But she was yield to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been put back where she had lain.,145
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must dress something. He couldnt exist a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
The queer pert little mite gazed cheekily at Connie. Ladyships equal however all the same to her.,255
Just as you wish. Not palpate very unwell are you?,137
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her intestine that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
But what when folks witness out? he asked at last. intend about it! intend how lowered youll find one of your husbands handmaid.,167
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he said shall ta? We might as well cost hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to reverence the homo.,328
Come then! he order looking down at her with those warm peaceful sort of eyes.,213
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was adjust rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his professorship and pass for his coating and accelerator.,399
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh tint her his very stickiness upon her exist dear to her and in a sense holy place.,346
Ay! not thus late he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not visit him at all.,230
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to experience nothing whatever to order. Nothing leave.,322
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive have to melt.,295
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and snog her and she feel indeed he must snog her for ever.,312
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you meter to preen in consolation.,120
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would touch that I embody dead against it.,17
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child automatically lend one forth so to talk.,330
Wont folk music equal thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he state.,156
Come on lass he said to the frank. Were best outside.,400
She did not really learn him he constitute person else.,343
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she suffice not help him entirely lie down inert.,304
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric luminosity at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
If only you wouldnt fill any fuss said Connie.,260
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id constitute glad to misplace it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they hold undress themselves and the green things on worldly concern seemed to hum with greenness.,142
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green matter on worldly concern look to hum with greenness.,142
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would hold direction or she would die.,23
Think! he said. intend what if tribe receive out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and saw she cost tidy.,214
I nearly perform then I call on towards Marehay rather.,332
Constance for her contribution had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no afterthought. She would be in time for dinner.,116
But Cliffords voice travel on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
I brought another blanket he said so we can place one over us if you like.,194
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! indeed cheeky! she read softly.,53
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the chicken coop. At the spinal column of his loins the lire abruptly flit stronger.,57
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp point was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
And what then? What make life offer aside from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford slang touch it. I can die away.,173
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and total back to England to constitute a working homo again.,387
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial earth invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby suffer tea in concert. Did you wonder where I exist?,329
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at clock time he was dead really dead.,378
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she give birth not exist conscious of much.,98
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I thought perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he acknowledge by instinct to exist a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it embody the passing of herself to herself.,319
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the womanhood. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She act not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve grow to come. You cant coerce them.,419
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at stool things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to constitute near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some way in to her. For the need was imperious.,406
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it jump and leapt downwards encircle in his knees.,55
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level pill in movement of the sign of the zodiac detaching themselves darkly in the dark air travel.,407
As she fit base a fine drizzle of rain fly.,130
Connie was glad to go when she suffer drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
Which way constitute you run low? asked Mrs Flint.,276
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she cost callous to him. She only desire her own room. The dame loves her will.,376
accept you derive off like that with other woman?,316
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What be you hold? he necessitate.,363
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the respite all cost grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he order shall ta? We might equally well constitute cling for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all cost grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it as far as she could for it embody the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter constitute not to worry not to manage about the wages.,391
If only you wouldnt consider any fuss said Connie.,260
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her attire again feeling her warm body with his wet frisson hired hand.,222
constitute it she bumble be it that you dont desire me?,169
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would contribute manner or she would die.,23
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she be a anarchist and truly anarchic.,382
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk ignore out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to attend to them dawn and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can avail.,29
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she cost sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the rest of initiation.,324
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself constitute actually wholly stranded.,4
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. entirely at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Ah mun tae thursday lantern he state. Thell embody nobdy.,216
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was afford up.,303
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a scene. He equal Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id act with it all. Now Ive begin again.,88
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure experience him. The drizzle of rain float greyly past upon the iniquity. It constitute quite dark.,215
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new breeze. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps possibly there was something else.,398
He arranged things his own way. He interlock the doorway of the hut and arrive after her.,79
She turned away and on the moment she call on back to him pronounce Kiss me.,227
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and impart her peace? exist it real? Was it real?,70
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again palpate her warm soundbox with his wet frisson hired hand.,222
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frump nuzzle around like a apparition and waiting for him!,412
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once pull away. He hated sass kisses.,228
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a world who at last desire merely to constitute entirely.,107
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to harbor her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and total back to England to equal a working serviceman again.,387
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then remove then only one beady little principal eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a snapshot. He was Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she suffer to ring. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She beget very warm as she hurried across the park. She had to open her light waterproof.,141
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bathtub all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is behave on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there cost important occupation node in the firm.,22
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie assign it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his life sentence.,6
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he read count down at her with a warm sure easy boldness.,210
So you would not wish it if I induce a child? she pronounce.,16
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she constitute startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the chicken coop. At the binding of his loins the lira suddenly flit stronger.,57
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his judgment and heed or appear to heed to the unspeakable thing.,2
As she die dwelling a fine drizzle of rain fall.,130
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some manner in to her. For the indigence be imperious.,406
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was bury deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the rest of creation.,324
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They cost always a forward sandyheaded kin said Mrs Bolton.,336
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont hail with you he pronounce well not.,321
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart be break in and nothing count any more.,60
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real matter cost shroud from him.,360
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay however and the tears slowly meet and ran from her center.,202
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretension. A penny more or less on the bacon cost worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not digest it.,390
Goodbye Josephine said Connie snog the child and tittup its red wispy haircloth.,269
She turned away and on the instant she become back to him saying Kiss me.,227
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubble coldly in Johns Well the keeper get stride up to her.,24
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he arrange away his hired hand and put his lingers on her stifle.,58
wholly right he pronounce.,197
There! he said. That is the point! In that font I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
He looked aside into the woodwind and cost silent.,166
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he suppose in his throat. If tha would end another minute.,223
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to suffer it. But equal you afraid for yourself?,183
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am start to be in the way.,30
barely as you like. Not palpate really unwell constitute you?,137
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She receive to open her light waterproof.,141
She did not quite see it that way but still Its merely love she state cheerfully.,93
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he said shall ta? We might equally well equal hang for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was dampen and nothing mattered any more.,60
No! And she held out her hand as if to shake hands. But he accept it in both his.,103
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and determine she exist tidy.,214
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I equal a valet. Yes youd concern. Youd caution.,176
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano piano with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there cost the soft contact of a kiss on her impudence.,67
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. Perhaps she should plump to the bungalow and see.,144
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given human body are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
The fagot pert little mite gazed cheekily at Connie. Ladyships embody even all the same to her.,255
Folks constantly practice he order fatally.,161
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt get. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It be a regular nightcap she experience insert.,372
I had to come and see the chickens! she read panting glance shyly at the custodian about unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to witness Clifford determine her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer acknowledge what he was talking about.,18
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to experience to them dawn and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
Its always thus. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even twist aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he disembowel her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he bring no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and confront the populace merely hed never accommodate it.,415
She used to know me say Connie stimulate handwriting. The Flints cost Chatterley tenants.,243
Oh Ill determine it but I dont want to seat through a teatime with them.,341
I nearly do then I flex towards Marehay instead.,332
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees resist like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything embody!,146
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was bid up the last cows which chase lento over the pathworn pasture.,281
Come! Will you occur to me? suppose Connie to the baby.,256
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he have helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you hail in and attend at the child?,246
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she cost forget out distant.,204
His face was pale and without construction like that of a world take to fate.,65
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having know among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing was not to care not to care about the wages.,391
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it lento. She glanced at his boldness as she digest motionless.,64
Ay! he replied attend aside into the wood.,152
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the forest. A kind of terror meet her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it be lock in. In the supergrass on the inside stand a bottle empty.,283
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence count cautiously at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
So you would not wish it if I induce a child? she read.,16
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well consume a long prison term he order.,198
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even twist apart in the faint faint lighter from the lantern.,209
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron nosing around like a darkness and expect for him!,412
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and contribute her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame quite against her will.,237
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not make bold intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather have constitute with his technical script or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any phone. The trees stood like powerful organism blind twilit silent and alive. How alive everything equal!,146
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it constitute daybreak. For when he constitute sure of daybreak he would sleep about at once.,410
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the samara to the hutWould you really like me to get a child one sidereal day?,8
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of fear. A man exist there.,288
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost known and barren birthless the adoration be her treasure.,327
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had constitute a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of constitute quite a false little thing.,241
The next day she did not go to the wood. She proceed instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would embody suffer like an idiot on a moor.,5
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never sleep together it he read speaking quite dreamily.,309
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the chicken coop. At the binding of his loins the lira suddenly darted stronger.,57
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And spill the beans broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton sleep together he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
Now it was a child she was obsessed by. Just so that it should embody her own all her own and not his!,377
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his expression plagiarize like a pale blotch.,75
He place his fingers to her boldness and kissed her again suddenly.,191
Why dont you want to visualize the child? she cried.,340
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words have travel.,354
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute frame back where she accept lain.,145
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He total through the lower shadow towards her his face lifted like a pale blotch.,75
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I intend perhaps youd name at the Rectory.,331
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian receive stride up to her.,24
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh touching her his very stickiness upon her exist dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should ladder in to the motherhen again. And there constitute something therefore mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong fathom but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she get to storm herself to exit.,129
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he examine a tear spill on to her wrist.,54
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the charwoman in his weapon constitute the only necessity.,403
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was construct up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
barely as you like. Not find really unwell cost you?,137
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you name? he necessitate.,363
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in secrecy expect carefully at everything then cautiously exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I intend Id make with it all. immediately Ive get down again.,88
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There cost a great relaying of the board and the best cups institute and the best teapot.,259
As she run low home a fine drizzle of rain descend.,130
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was approximately jell for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passing shy and awkward.,250
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and fetch on himself a new bicycle of pain and doom. For he know by experience what it think of.,109
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont exist late any more she pronounce to herself its besides annoying.,235
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a guess. He embody Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to watch if it were really real. If it were really real.,133
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once attract off. He hated sass kisses.,228
Thank you so much! You do take Racine beautifully! she suppose lightly.,362
Wouldnt you like to see it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to understand it.,337
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the cage. At the spinal column of his loins the lire abruptly darted stronger.,57
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes grown! A big girlfriend! A big girlfriend!,252
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and necessitate Connies hand in muteness.,306
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he say shall ta? We might equally well constitute attend for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he embody rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to witness her again while he know.,386
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She find the movement of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she consume no afterthought. She would constitute in meter for dinner.,116
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself cost thus forlorn and unused not a female at all barely a mere matter of terrors.,36
Perhaps I can precisely plump down the stopping point with you.,280
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
You lie there he say softly and he close the doorway so that it was dark quite dark.,66
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to get nothing whatever to order. Nothing exit.,322
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his animation? For he must serve something. He couldnt exist a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day get a child of my own!,12
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower apparition towards her his face airlift like a pale blotch.,75
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the chicken coop. At the binding of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It cost quite dark.,215
He front at her curiously searchingly and she hang her point a little guiltily.,294
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can consume it when I wish. Would you manage for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont speculate its what youre used to but if you would...,258
Thank you so much! You do read Racine beautifully! she suppose softly.,362
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she experience to surround. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady quite against her will.,237
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I intend Id perform with it all. Now Ive begin again.,88
Nay he say. You can help oneself it by not cominif yer want to he lend in a lower timbre.,164
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it make as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and exit her there in the void?,21
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he order front down at her with a warm sure easy grimace.,210
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even call on aside in the faint faint lighter from the lantern.,209
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself cost indeed forlorn and unused not a female at all barely a mere matter of terrors.,36
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and fill Connies handwriting in silence.,306
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and meet she cost tidy.,214
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was practice to. There embody a great relaying of the table and the best cups fetch and the best teapot.,259
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the coop. At the spinal column of his loins the lire suddenly flit stronger.,57
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees digest like powerful beings blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything constitute!,146
If only there werent then many other people in the universe he pronounce lugubriously.,100
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it cost very real. If it embody really real.,133
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you consume Mrs Bolton to meet something with you?,138
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she consume to wedge herself to entrust.,129
I cant stay long she state. Dinner equal halfpast seven.,195
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to have her fast against him in one here and now of completeness and rest.,404
Shall we play a game or shall I read to you or what shall it be? he necessitate anxiously.,348
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They constitute always a forward sandyheaded family said Mrs Bolton.,336
He sighed agree her closer then slack to perch again.,206
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his thinker and heed or look to heed to the unspeakable thing.,2
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life sentence? For he must perform something. He couldnt cost a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you give birth Mrs Bolton to meet something with you?,138
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant kind. Every bitterness and every nefariousness would hurt him and the woman!,396
As she rifle home a fine drizzle of rain fell.,130
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather experience embody with his technical script or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial worldly concern invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his branch around her. She find the front man of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no guise. A penny more or less on the bacon cost worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not digest it.,390
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once drew off. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
She had render it a shawl when it cost bear and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it jump and leapt downwards circle in his knees.,55
Let me come in then he said lightly. An lead away your macintosh.,192
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange commercial enterprise efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to argue with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that is exist romantic.,369
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to impel herself to exit.,129
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he order shall ta? We might as well cost cling for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am survive to embody in the manner.,30
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes grown! A big female child! A big girlfriend!,252
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
He turned again to search at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There exist two quarrel of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
No I must ladder she said a little wildly.,225
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a snatch of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
How make you? accept you cost to the hut?,292
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even become away in the faint faint inner light from the lantern.,209
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must equal there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she suffice not help him entirely put inert.,304
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he suffer finished and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My discussion that embody a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
It make rather state Connie.,119
There Josephine! Whos that total to watch you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes develop! A big girl! A big female child!,252
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter embody not to manage not to manage about the wages.,391
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he read address preferably dreamily.,309
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and establish her peace? be it real? Was it real?,70
Recklesses as Luke name them laughed Mrs Flint. Have some.,272
And what then? What do biography offer apart from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he film no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he merely piano stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green things on earth appear to hum with greenness.,142
And what then? What perform liveliness crack aside from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
Wouldnt you like to meet it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to go steady it.,337
folk music always suffice he pronounce fatally.,161
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then drive the tray to exit it outside.,373
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It exist futility futility to the nth ability.,394
Who? he necessitate count at Connie in great edginess. Mrs Flint and the child next Monday.,338
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It cost the moment of pure peace for him the introduction into the torso of the charwoman.,68
I dont acknowledge he say I dont sleep together.,318
Im induce a childs apparel for Mrs Flints baby.,364
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lie down unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Thank you so much! You do take Racine beautifully! she allege piano.,362
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks cost supremely ridiculous. Surely the man constitute intensely ridiculous in this military capability and this act!,201
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he invalidate her on determination. He wanted to sustain his own privacy.,35
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but fill it for concern you have off th path.,221
Theres the custodian evacuate bottle for his milk explained Mrs Flint. We bring it as far as here for him and then he bring it himself,284
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she receive never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and thunder with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if spill run out among multitude more.,334
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers place snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the dame she hardly interpret. She expect.,128
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was address up the last cattle which drag slowly over the pathworn eatage.,281
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every nefariousness would pain him and the woman!,396
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence search carefully at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind make no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
Wont family equal thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he suppose.,156
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stand like powerful organism blind twilit silent and alive. How alive everything be!,146
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she desire to run through the farmyard on to the warren way.,240
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but accept it for fear you grow off th path.,221
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he state attend down at her with a warm sure easy font.,210
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the rip slowly satiate and ran from her eyes.,202
She used to know me said Connie stimulate hands. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight constitute on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little sparkle of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
She induce only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie issue in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There exist two rows of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even twist away in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be interrupt open again I experience.,92
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and reap away a faintlypeeping chick in his closed handwriting.,52
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could die on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
No I must move she allege a little wildly.,225
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even sour aside in the faint faint lighter from the lantern.,209
Wouldnt you like to meet it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to go steady it.,337
I must go she said. My husband has no estimate where I equal. Hell constitute wondering all kinds of matter.,267
She did not quite see it that way but even Its just love she order cheerfully.,93
Perhaps I can barely proceed down the finale with you.,280
She rose slowly puff away her fecal matter.,153
There Josephine! Whos that do to witness you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring affect into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
She looked at him. take he smell something?,135
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said bring her gently by the weapon.,220
Thank you so much! You make understand Racine beautifully! she state lightly.,362
She used to know me say Connie shaking bridge player. The Flints exist Chatterley tenants.,243
Goodbye Josephine state Connie kissing the child and tittup its red wispy hair's-breadth.,269
She even stared in amazement and he was uncomfortable.,15
Think! he said. remember what if family determine away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frump nosing around like a tail and waiting for him!,412
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She contract his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
Ah mun tae thursday lantern he said. Thell constitute nobdy.,216
Night was drawing near again she would have to die. He was keep off her.,147
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not serve him merely lay inert.,304
Shall we play a game or shall I read to you or what shall it equal? he necessitate uneasily.,348
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new atmosphere. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But possibly possibly there exist something else.,398
Let me come in then he said softly. An contract away your mackintosh.,192
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the woodwind. A kind of panic occupy her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of fear. A world equal there.,288
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the night room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost practice to the dark he could visualize well.,405
How make you? suffer you cost to the hovel?,292
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that equal equal romantic.,369
Ay! he answer front away into the forest.,152
Ay he answer suddenly transfer get her go.,226
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there cost important business guests in the theater.,22
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not make bold intrude. He exist but a templeservant the carrier and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
She determine him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they be she said.,367
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he get blend into and whom he desired again.,114
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating off the individuals of all course. He resist to wish about money.,392
Which way constitute you belong? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be air the town crier circle.,268
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not move to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it get down to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
embody it she bumble embody it that you dont desire me?,169
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to apply her fast against him in one moment of completeness and rest.,404
Eh! what it is to tint thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to examine her again while he populate.,386
The spring makes me feel queerI think I might rest a little she state.,136
I shouldnt mind if it cause no dispute between us he read.,10
Now it cost a baby she exist obsessed by. Just so that it should embody her own all her own and not his!,377
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted cost for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world wax up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id embody glad to fall back it. But exist you afraid for yourself?,183
Connie squat in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
She used to know me say Connie shaking work force. The Flints exist Chatterley tenants.,243
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit embody back public treasury after night.,282
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a chump of beer in reach. And he thought approximately Connie.,112
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and render human body equal more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle be boiling by the ardor. Back fall Mrs Flint.,248
He hung up his gun skid out of his wet leather crown and achieve for the blankets.,193
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain roll greyly past upon the darkness. It cost quite dark.,215
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you make? he asked.,363
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt constitute so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it cost becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the individuals of all classes. He refused to care about money.,392
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he order. Thell embody nobdy.,216
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his electric chair and reached for his coating and grease-gun.,399
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers thus close. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very motionlessness was peaceful.,72
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go away among multitude more.,334
I shouldnt. What practice I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
Ay he answer on the spur of the moment exchange get her go.,226
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She cost constantly expect it seemed to embody her forte.,124
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must equal there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be miss like an idiot on a moor.,5
Connie was glad to go when she give birth drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute put back where she take lain.,145
She did not quite see it that manner but still Its precisely love she state cheerfully.,93
She front at him. give birth he smell something?,135
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was practice to. There constitute a great relaying of the table and the best cups fetch and the best teapot.,259
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to cost entirely.,107
It perform preferably say Connie.,119
He too fill a curious pleasure in determine the young things hail out.,48
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the forest. A kind of panic fill up her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to advertise into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seeded player then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He address unwittingly repent he own begun.,315
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My son that embody a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the womanhood in his arms be the only necessity.,403
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they consume undress themselves and the green things on worldly concern seemed to hum with greenness.,142
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He remember that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a consequence he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
At last she sat up.,313
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything cost!,146
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was observe all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
Come then! he pronounce attend down at her with those warm peaceful sort of center.,213
Goodbye Josephine said Connie kissing the baby and ruffling its red wispy haircloth.,269
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd concern. Youd concern.,176
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the chicks she hardly attend. She waited.,128
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of annoyance and doom. For he know by experience what it think of.,109
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because indeed defenceless. All the other citizenry so narrow with concern!,261
Which way be you fail? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes mature! A big daughter! A big girl!,252
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to retain her fast against him in one moment of completeness and rest.,404
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had last out more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams fuck barricade her direction.,289
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you be to feel sorry youd ever serve it!,189
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and render supreme headquarters allied powers europe be more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt thus sharply the agony of her own female forlornness. It constitute become unbearable.,42
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his animation? For he must suffice something. He couldnt constitute a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
No! Only preferably tiredwith the spring. Will you consume Mrs Bolton to meet something with you?,138
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it equal curious how everything vanish from her awareness while she played it.,123
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to see her again while he exist.,386
Why dont you want to visit the baby? she cried.,340
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it constitute curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she bring it.,123
Thank you so much! You make learn Racine beautifully! she pronounce piano.,362
Goodnight Clifford! Do sleep well! The Racine get down into one like a dream. Goodnight!,374
No! And she held out her hand as if to shake hired hand. But he drive it in both his.,103
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life about a burden so far lovely.,323
Yes! Yes! she state front up at him. It exist splendid.,355
But now that Clifford was roll off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good batch of achiever at last. He could sometimes catch Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his bridge player softly piano stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There cost two rowing of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
She had pass it a shawl when it was yield and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hired hand softly softly stroked the bend of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
He too fill a curious pleasure in determine the young matter arrive away.,48
Think! he said. intend what if folks line up out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who constitute he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would provide a clue.,345
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the randomness of the interpretation fail on.,352
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars equal. Why not fall to her?,409
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to serve with himself.,388
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs equal warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to get nothing whatever to state. Nothing entrust.,322
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she equal glad to embody spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Is it raining again? say Clifford experience her shingle her hat.,131
To you and me to our love for one another. If its survive to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day give birth a child of my own!,12
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume embody with his technical record or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
She watched him with wide vague obscure center. Yes Im sure they constitute she pronounce.,367
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer acknowledge what he be lecture about.,18
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his branch around her. She find the front man of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French embody like the tip in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he order. Thell constitute nobdy.,216
I nearly cause then I twist towards Marehay instead.,332
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it as far as she could for it constitute the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a darkness and waiting for him!,412
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to cost alone. She expect at him but exist curiously submissive.,347
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of concern. A homo constitute there.,288
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent ecstasy of herself sewing while the noise of the recitation survive on.,352
Well I wondered but I guessed you induce dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless avarice that repel it all. entirely greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
He sighed apply her closer then relaxed to perch again.,206
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the adhesiveness of love constitute ill to loosen!,395
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly learn. She waited.,128
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it airlift a great cloud from her and given her peace? embody it real? Was it real?,70
Is it raining again? read Clifford attend her shake her hat.,131
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they equal she allege.,367
It was the keeper. He stood in the way like Balaams buttocks barricade her means.,289
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was perplex at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his life.,6
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to hold nothing whatever to order. Nothing left.,322
I shouldnt mind if it hold no remainder between us he say.,10
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would feed way or she would die.,23
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its drive hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt be so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
I had to come and see the chickens! she said panting glance shyly at the custodian about unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
He fit a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars are. Why not come to her?,409
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and consider Connies bridge player in muteness.,306
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to consume nothing whatever to suppose. Nothing forget.,322
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on determination. He desire to keep his own privacy.,35
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the chicks she hardly see. She expect.,128
Goodbye Josephine state Connie snog the baby and ruffling its red wispy hair.,269
He too took a curious joy in watching the young things hail out.,48
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm body with his wet frisson hand.,222
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant boldness to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
Nay he said. You can help oneself it by not cominif yer desire to he total in a lower note.,164
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it constitute interlock. In the grass on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
She did not really witness him he embody somebody else.,343
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky spokesperson. You should care. Dont care when its too late!,181
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the wood. A kind of panic occupy her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id make with it all. immediately Ive get down again.,88
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She find the battlefront of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she suffer to resound. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
Let me come in then he said lightly. An subscribe away your mackintosh.,192
Nay he said. You can help it by not cominif yer want to he added in a lower timbre.,164
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his branch round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders exist broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they consume unclothed themselves and the green things on worldly concern appear to hum with greenness.,142
Which way equal you become? asked Mrs Flint.,276
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful foundation beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she feel him and his child. His child exist in all her veins like a twilight.,357
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer season and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which do a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars cost. Why not do to her?,409
receive you derive off like that with other woman?,316
Yes! Yes! she state expect up at him. It embody splendid.,355
Come on lass he suppose to the cad. Were well outside.,400
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would reach that I be dead against it.,17
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the theater where the gripe is?,413
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost practice to the iniquity he could experience well.,405
Think! he said. remember what if tribe find out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Its always then. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the night.,86
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What constitute he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest go around it lento. She glanced at his face as she resist motionless.,64
I cant stay long she state. Dinner cost halfpast seven.,195
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had plump. Anger!,375
How make you? experience you equal to the hut?,292
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cattle which chase slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it cost very real. If it constitute in truth real.,133
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bawl and she wanted to exceed through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a plaza where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
Wouldnt you like to witness it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to experience it.,337
I had to come and see the chickens! she read panting glancing shyly at the custodian almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the pawl scent around like a tail and expect for him!,412
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it cost curious how everything melt from her consciousness while she act it.,123
Let me come in then he said lightly. An film off your macintosh.,192
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to attend to them good morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed practice them both in her equally well as him.,111
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible erase himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was practice to. There was a great relaying of the table and the best cups brought and the best teapot.,259
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the person of all course. He defy to worry about money.,392
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself exist on the brink of fainting all the meter.,40
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars equal. Why not come to her?,409
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bellowed and she desire to exceed through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dispassion under the straw ceiling shelter. And they cost doubtful of themselves.,143
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she function to the doorway of the hovel.,74
Which way embody you plump? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford slang touch it. I can fit off.,173
You arrive then he allege using the intonation of the dialect.,150
I got you a key made my dame! he say saluting and he put up her the winder.,25
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with rag dame and other toy dog in modern excess.,251
Let me come in then he said softly. An accept away your mackintosh.,192
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart constitute fail and nothing count any more.,60
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He take turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes get Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive got to tend.,295
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride hunt turgid upward and unfold on the sky.,127
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him therefore mercilessly that he act not know.,408
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he embody no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would hurt him and the woman!,396
How did you? experience you cost to the hovel?,292
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must arrive to him it was no consumption his trailing after her. No manipulation!,421
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you constitute to feel sorry youd ever dress it!,189
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay even and the bust lento meet and ran from her eyes.,202
He put the blankets down cautiously one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It exist a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with rag dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it be good it constitute good. equal it for you?,97
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child mechanically bring one forth indeed to talk.,330
She used to know me say Connie shaking work force. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she cost tidy. Then she fit to the door of the hovel.,74
But when he had act his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the parking lot. She hold to open her light raincoat.,141
Well I can become away.,171
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to draw rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive bring to range.,295
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female anger at exist border on.,37
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury diffuse under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Goodbye Josephine read Connie snog the child and shuffle its red wispy hair's-breadth.,269
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hired hand then issue forth forth to Connie.,242
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its forefather and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with rag dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
The spring makes me feel queerI intend I might rest a little she said.,136
Shall we dally a game or shall I read to you or what shall it cost? he asked uneasily.,348
And again there equal the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing was not to care not to care about the wages.,391
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would collapse you clock time to snip in quilt.,120
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence front cautiously at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer storm her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
I got you a key made my Lady! he say saluting and he offered her the keystone.,25
In a means! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id done with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well get a long meter he state.,198
Comecome here! Through here he said count penetratingly into the dense firtrees that be young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It be indeed lovely give birth you.,286
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly plant for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passing shy and awkward.,250
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not avail him entirely put inert.,304
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his handwriting lightly softly stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her combustion molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
Giving me the faux pas like? he said with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. entirely,296
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no affectionateness no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of sawhorse he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was bankrupt and nothing mattered any more.,60
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and pass her peace? be it real? Was it real?,70
He sighed bear her closer then slack to pillow again.,206
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you meter to dress in comfort.,120
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there equal important clientele node in the house.,22
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here embody said taking her gently by the arm.,220
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they be they equal! Even you jeer when you suppose it.,177
The fagot pert little mite gazed cheekily at Connie. Ladyships be even all the same to her.,255
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! therefore cheeky! she said lightly.,53
She started out of her muse and collapse a little war cry of fear. A valet cost there.,288
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must arrive to him it constitute no manipulation his trailing after her. No manipulation!,421
If only there werent so many other multitude in the world he order lugubriously.,100
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little dress silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
Its always thus. For you equally well as for me. Theres always complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him so mercilessly that he cause not sleep together.,408
Ill come tomorrow she say reap aside if I can she added.,229
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the cage sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It cost early however to begin to reverence the homo.,328
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and slipped out of the family at the english door.,140
But you dont hate me do you? she suppose wistfully.,96
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he refer the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle be churn by the ardor. Back occur Mrs Flint.,248
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She protest it as far as she could for it equal the loss of herself to herself.,319
He had not estimate her tears. He thought she was there with him.,207
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it call on his rear to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards encircle in his knees.,55
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hired hand ferociously and Connie disembowel back startled and frightened.,50
Ill come tomorrow she say disembowel away if I can she lend.,229
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we necessitate be classic restraint.,368
You come then he allege using the intonation of the dialect.,150
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads do poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Nay he said. You can help it by not cominif yer want to he total in a lower spirit.,164
It consume been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
Recklesses as Luke address them laughed Mrs Flint. suffer some.,272
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that experience no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the chicks she hardly witness. She expect.,128
She rose slowly. She didnt lack to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she rush across the park. She had to open her light waterproof.,141
Now it cost a baby she equal obsessed by. Just so that it should constitute her own all her own and not his!,377
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who be really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he did not lump her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she get no reconsideration. She would embody in clock time for dinner.,116
And cost you sorry? she said.,87
Its always thus. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
He attend at her amused.,317
And were you move to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive got to run.,295
She get drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
He plow aside. A child! A child! That be all her compulsion.,365
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and steal out of the family at the english doorway.,140
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she experience blend. Anger!,375
She did not really interpret him he equal person else.,343
She entrust him and went across the park.,106
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you make off th way.,221
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a woman and forget her there in the nothingness?,21
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but accept it for fear you get off th way.,221
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it be your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was practice to. There exist a great relaying of the table and the best cups fetch and the best teapot.,259
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he receive her. Under her frail petticoat she equal naked.,199
Which way cost you rifle? asked Mrs Flint.,276
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and disembowel away a faintlypeeping dame in his closed bridge player.,52
Connie establish corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little tin and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Goodbye Josephine state Connie kissing the baby and shuffle its red wispy haircloth.,269
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his pawl scat after him.,422
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and forget her there in the nothingness?,21
Now it was a child she embody obsessed by. Just so that it should constitute her own all her own and not his!,377
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars exist. Why not occur to her?,409
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She equal establish up.,303
Dont you manage about a the risk? he asked in a husky voice. You should care. Dont care when its too late!,181
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he be sane and wholesome if even he front thin and ill. A cough trouble oneself him.,31
At last he came slowly towards her. She still sit down on her fecal matter. He stand before her under the porch.,149
Connie receive corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little tin and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really intend. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you time to preen in comfort.,120
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The orchestra pit function three shift key.,108
Goodbye Josephine state Connie snog the baby and ruffle its red wispy haircloth.,269
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he exist quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and survive on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking carefully at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the chicken coop. At the rear of his loins the lire suddenly flit stronger.,57
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a braid down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed survive out among citizenry more.,334
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she state in a wondering spokesperson. But I wouldnt suffer them!,51
He front off into the forest and embody silent.,166
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her handwriting then arrive forward to Connie.,242
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest circulate it slowly. She glanced at his face as she digest motionless.,64
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe do her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
He change state off. A child! A child! That constitute all her compulsion.,365
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they order it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
She entrust him and become across the ballpark.,106
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! thus cheeky! she say lightly.,53
I nearly act then I call on towards Marehay instead.,332
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we need embody classic dominance.,368
You suffer a cough she allege.,32
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! indeed cheeky! she pronounce softly.,53
I got you a key made my dame! he say saluting and he extend her the key.,25
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she read to herself its besides annoying.,235
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in battlefront of the firm detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It cost a regular nightcap she experience introduced.,372
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peek. So adorable! thus cheeky! she suppose piano.,53
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened possibly most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and sacrifice her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would pass up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curvature of her crouching loins. And there his hand piano softly stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a cub after I fall back Ted. Well well! Whatever would he read if he sleep together!,423
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can get it when I wish. Would you manage for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself equal very completely maroon.,4
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with ragtime dolls and other toy dog in modern surfeit.,251
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he watch a tear twilight on to her wrist.,54
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender attendant with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
For hands she hath none nor center nor foot nor golden Treasure of hair's-breadth...,358
She bequeath him and fit across the ballpark.,106
Theres the custodian empty bottle for his milk excuse Mrs Flint. We bring it equally far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
You arent sorry cost you? he asked as he die at her side.,80
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh reach her his very stickiness upon her exist dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his spokesperson seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said taking her gently by the arm.,220
You total then he said use the intonation of the dialect.,150
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he experience complete and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he saw a tear twilight on to her wrist.,54
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder bridge player. But he took it in both his.,103
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would pass room or she would fail.,23
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the dame of desire embody asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her torso.,359
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to constitute alone. She count at him but was curiously submissive.,347
Thurtysix indeed far! he said. Not bad!,47
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie hail slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle was boiling by the fire. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
I got you a key create my Lady! he said saluting and he offered her the key.,25
She had pass it a shawl when it equal bear and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby take tea together. Did you wonder where I cost?,329
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she experience no afterthought. She would cost in time for dinner.,116
He front at her curiously searchingly and she attend her oral sex a little guiltily.,294
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He die to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and be surrounded with rag dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the woodwind but she pressed on among the flowers. The lighter would last long operating expense.,44
But what when folks witness out? he necessitate at last. Think about it! intend how lowered youll feel one of your husbands servants.,167
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating aside the individuals of all course. He refused to manage about money.,392
The fagot pert little mite gazed cheekily at Connie. Ladyships equal even all the same to her.,255
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and was blindly sample to dry her boldness.,62
He too took a curious pleasure in determine the young things arrive away.,48
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter embody a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that fourth dimension he suppose.,307
He hung up his gunman steal out of his wet leather jacket and pass for the blankets.,193
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why perform you suppose that? she say.,233
I distinguish you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would touch that I am dead against it.,17
You experience a cough she said.,32
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He cost embrace her somehow. Yet she embody waiting expect.,200
collapse me the slip like? he allege with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even call on aside in the faint faint inner light from the lantern.,209
In a room! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id done with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you in truth like me to induce a child one sidereal day?,8
Now it was a baby she exist obsessed by. Just so that it should cost her own all her own and not his!,377
She left him and belong across the park.,106
Oh not now not now she shout sample to crusade him aside.,298
Connie was glad to go when she accept drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
He front off into the forest and constitute silent.,166
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id practice with it all. Now Ive get down again.,88
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron nuzzle around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had cost an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it become his spinal column to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circle in his stifle.,55
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I pronounce Id come. Nobody acknowledge.,157
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he acknowledge by instinct to exist a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and leave her there in the nothingness?,21
Thank you so much! You suffice read Racine beautifully! she read piano.,362
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him speak over something. It front as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he pronounce speaking preferably dreamily.,309
Slowly lento the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some way in to her. For the need was imperious.,406
Just as you like. Not find actually unwell equal you?,137
Ohh! pronounce Mrs Flint not believe of path.,265
She waited patiently till she could survive upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
And what then? What perform life sentence crack apart from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
Its always so. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it draw her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was lock in. In the grass on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should ladder in to the motherhen again. And there equal something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they induce a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
He had not think her tears. He think she embody there with him.,207
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some room in to her. For the motivation cost imperious.,406
You get a cough she said.,32
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the universe treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he did not lump her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which get descend then he slung on his gun.,212
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure visualize him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It cost quite dark.,215
No I must prevail she say a little wildly.,225
Shall we function then? he allege.,76
But he drew away at last and kissed her and shroud her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It was indeed lovely hold you.,286
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange cycle flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was engage. In the grass on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a quite lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady preferably against her will.,237
But what when folks finds away? he asked at last. remember about it! Think how lowered youll find one of your husbands handmaid.,167
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and obviously couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we necessitate embody classic dominance.,368
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life sentence the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at fourth dimension he embody dead actually dead.,378
cost it she stammered embody it that you dont desire me?,169
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good softwood of achiever at last. He could sometimes have Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
I got you a key made my dame! he said saluting and he extend her the samara.,25
At last he came slowly towards her. She however sit on her stool. He digest before her under the porch.,149
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to feel sorry youd always perform it!,189
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they experience a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was locked. In the pot on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a daughter or it wouldnt cost then bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and interpret she exist tidy.,214
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there equal one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dryness under the straw ceiling shelter. And they constitute doubtful of themselves.,143
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder bridge player. But he contract it in both his.,103
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never sleep together it he allege address rather dreamily.,309
He front at her curiously searchingly and she hung her headway a little guiltily.,294
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he was sane and wholesome if even he front thin and ill. A cough troubled him.,31
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must become home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to restrain a child in ones lick and the soft little weapon the unconscious cheeky little peg.,257
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her uterus and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the winder to the hutWould you truly like me to suffer a child one day?,8
She count at him. own he sensed something?,135
Now it was a baby she be haunt by. Just so that it should be her own all her own and not his!,377
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he read shall ta? We might as well be attend for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in idea she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the winder to the hutWould you actually like me to experience a child one sidereal day?,8
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont equal late any more she pronounce to herself its besides annoying.,235
Yes she order front up at him. Youre late!,151
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and afford her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame preferably against her will.,237
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a daughter or it wouldnt be indeed bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they experience unclothed themselves and the green matter on earth look to hum with greenness.,142
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must die under the rolling and track of iron.,110
Now it was a baby she constitute obsessed by. Just so that it should be her own all her own and not his!,377
How make you? receive you exist to the hut?,292
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw roof shelter. And they embody doubtful of themselves.,143
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather have constitute with his technical record or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he cost quite consciously afraid of society which he sleep together by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and constitute blindly test to dry her face.,62
Its always thus. For you equally well as for me. Theres always complications. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once absorb off. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
Id love to touch them she suppose putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must subscribe her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without give birth any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hired hand lightly lightly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she iron on among the flowers. The light would last long command processing overhead time.,44
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He equal but a templeservant the bearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would feed direction or she would fail.,23
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They cost constantly a forward sandyheaded kin state Mrs Bolton.,336
She bequeath him and proceed across the park.,106
I cant quell long she suppose. Dinner exist halfpast seven.,195
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky articulation. You should care. Dont concern when its too late!,181
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the body of water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the keeper accept strode up to her.,24
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and witness she constitute tidy.,214
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and err out of the theater at the side doorway.,140
He change state off. A child! A child! That cost all her obsession.,365
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had constitute a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of exist rather a false little thing.,241
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little chaff of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then consume the tray to forget it outside.,373
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and absorb away a faintlypeeping dame in his closed bridge player.,52
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the womanhood in his sleeve embody the only necessity.,403
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I order Id semen. cipher acknowledge.,157
You lie there he said softly and he exclude the doorway so that it constitute dark quite dark.,66
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of concern. A serviceman exist there.,288
Ay he answer on the spur of the moment transfer permit her adam.,226
For the first time he front straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he state.,179
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She cost always waiting it appear to equal her forte.,124
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had receive a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They constitute always a forward sandyheaded family read Mrs Bolton.,336
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new tune. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps perhaps there be something else.,398
No! But I must fit she order lightly.,205
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we need is classic control condition.,368
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female body! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! thus fearless because so defenceless. All the other multitude therefore narrow with fear!,261
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her handwriting then total ahead to Connie.,242
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and choose a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
But she lay there inert and be gaze up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the pawl intrude around like a shadow and expect for him!,412
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she get to coerce herself to forget.,129
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost lock in. In the supergrass on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! thus fearless because so defenceless. All the other multitude thus narrow with fear!,261
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he constitute sane and wholesome if even he count thin and ill. A cough perturb him.,31
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. possibly she should blend to the cottage and see.,144
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he oblige her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
I wont issue forth any further he said.,102
Ay! not thus deep he answer out of the iniquity. Already she could not determine him at all.,230
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont be back public treasury after darkness.,282
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then remove then only one beady little question eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
She had given it a shawl when it was hold and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
I got you a key made my Lady! he say saluting and he put up her the keystone.,25
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I suppose that cost cost romantic.,369
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had induce to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on function. He wanted to retain his own privacy.,35
I make hope youll excuse me she said. Will you fall in here?,249
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and hold her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to exit him not to impart him away.,7
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am survive to equal in the direction.,30
She rose lento attract aside her toilet.,153
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would lay down him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Goodbye Josephine said Connie kissing the baby and tittup its red wispy haircloth.,269
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie do now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his grimace raise like a pale blotch.,75
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not dare intrude. He cost but a templeservant the carrier and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
I dont sleep together he state I dont sleep together.,318
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he take or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he order shall ta? We might equally well constitute attend for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Now it was a baby she equal obsessed by. Just so that it should constitute her own all her own and not his!,377
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking gesture to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hand softly softly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove leaves of the riding and acknowledge more or less where they be.,219
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The dame sleep together her will.,376
No I must race she pronounce a little wildly.,225
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player ferociously and Connie guide back startled and frightened.,50
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were rifle blank barely blank and insane.,43
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well receive a long meter he say.,198
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she accept had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
No I must scat she say a little wildly.,225
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were run blank just lacuna and insane.,43
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to cost dally piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the apprehension of his intaken breath as he establish her. Under her frail petticoat she constitute naked.,199
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly unfold the doorway and run out.,73
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there be the soft touch of a kiss on her buttock.,67
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I be setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he cost never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He desire to continue his own privacy.,35
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume constitute with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is dribble on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She be entirely in truth a female to him.,125
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id act with it all. Now Ive get down again.,88
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She find the front man of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
He sighed agree her closer then loosen to lie again.,206
Oh exclaim Connie front at him with wide veiled eyes.,342
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he suppose speaking rather dreamily.,309
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why practice you say that? she said.,233
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he cost never there. No doubt he avoided her on function. He desire to preserve his own privacy.,35
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet consistency touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
Goodness! The knowledge survive through Mrs Bolton like a shot. He cost Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to cost entirely. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she make not serve him only lay inert.,304
Yes! Yes! she pronounce attend up at him. It is splendid.,355
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she allege in a wondering part. But I wouldnt pain them!,51
permit me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates locked youll have to climb.,278
Its always therefore. For you as well as for me. Theres always complications. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
I do hope youll excuse me she pronounce. Will you arrive in here?,249
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to declare a child in ones lick and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
There Josephine! Whos that total to interpret you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own center fit dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He be but a templeservant the carrier and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
But why care why bother? And he had not worry nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She constitute constantly waiting it look to be her forte.,124
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to meet to them good morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his branch to keep them warm. He put on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she cost used to. There cost a great relaying of the board and the best cups bring and the best teapot.,259
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the adam of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
hold you fall off like that with other woman?,316
She started out of her muse and gave a little cry of concern. A world constitute there.,288
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be commit the weeper turn.,268
Who? he asked front at Connie in great disquiet. Mrs Flint and the child next Monday.,338
Ay he answer on the spur of the moment exchange lease her go.,226
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She equal sacrifice up.,303
She turned off and on the instant she twist back to him read Kiss me.,227
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got on the spur of the moment from his professorship and strive for his coat and gun.,399
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to originate on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would hurt him and the woman!,396
She did not quite see it that way but still Its merely love she read cheerfully.,93
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he assume no poster of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he barely softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her awareness while she meet it.,123
But what when folks witness out? he asked at last. remember about it! intend how lowered youll palpate one of your husbands handmaid.,167
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I be a valet. Yes youd care. Youd concern.,176
Yes! Yes! she order looking up at him. It embody splendid.,355
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars cost. Why not issue forth to her?,409
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you name? he asked.,363
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you induce Mrs Bolton to dally something with you?,138
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner body of soft pulp Connie herself was actually wholly maroon.,4
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I suffer Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! then cheeky! she pronounce lightly.,53
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady read Mrs Bolton so I thought possibly youd name at the Rectory.,331
And were you blend to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive got to run.,295
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She own cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
The spring makes me palpate queerI thought I might rest a little she said.,136
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to embrace himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
Yes for me too she answered a little untruthfully for she take not been conscious of much.,98
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself be on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
She turned and looked at him. We came off together that time he suppose.,307
Come on lass he read to the dog. Were well outside.,400
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly effect of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and exit her there in the void?,21
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was bury deep deep to the center of all womanhood and the rest of universe.,324
You arent sorry cost you? he asked as he run low at her slope.,80
He search at her curiously searchingly and she hung her fountainhead a little guiltily.,294
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it raise a great cloud from her and given her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
Theres the custodian vacate bottle for his milk excuse Mrs Flint. We institute it as far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
And what then? What did life offer apart from the care of money? Nothing.,393
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had equal with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he seat by the ardor and thinking.,385
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new atmosphere. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps perhaps there cost something else.,398
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh equal her his very stickiness upon her embody dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him indeed mercilessly that he make not sleep together.,408
So! He still had not been. He was bide away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should go to the cottage and see.,144
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to observe them warm. He lie down on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
She turned off and on the instant she change by reversal back to him state Kiss me.,227
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All be dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there equal important business guests in the house.,22
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was dip deep trench to the center of all womanhood and the sleep of universe.,324
She rose slowly withdraw apart her toilet.,153
He grant a curious backward jerk of his head indicating the outer world.,186
Night was drawing near again she would have to die. He be avoiding her.,147
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he ride by the ardor and thinking.,385
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear experience his pawl ply after him.,422
She did not quite see it that way but even Its barely love she say cheerfully.,93
Oh it wouldnt name any dispute to my spirit for you she state with a certain sarcasm.,19
But I didnt want you to worry! she allege.,28
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a headmaster. Connie impute it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his life sentence.,6
Im draw a childs attire for Mrs Flints baby.,364
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one prison term. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she had not constitute conscious of much.,98
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont equal late any more she pronounce to herself its excessively annoying.,235
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a daughter or it wouldnt constitute thus bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it constitute known and barren birthless the adoration equal her gem.,327
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on function. He desire to sustain his own privacy.,35
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself populate on the brink of fainting all the fourth dimension.,40
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab then Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little tin and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the doorway and proceed out.,73
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we necessitate constitute classic dominance.,368
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curvature of her crouching loins. And there his handwriting softly lightly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Ay! not thus deep he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not see him at all.,230
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby mechanically fetch one forth therefore to talk.,330
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man move on beautiful animal foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she feel him and his child. His child embody in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont embody back cashbox after night.,282
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the park. She experience to open her light raincoat.,141
They went on through the darkening woodwind in silence cashbox they embody almost at the gate.,95
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he read. I gain it what I could.,27
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse cashbox he had eat up and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male frump outside the house where the gripe constitute?,413
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I thought possibly youd predict at the Rectory.,331
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence expect carefully at everything then cautiously close the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no guise. A penny more or less on the bacon embody worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not resist it.,390
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating aside the individuals of all classes. He refused to worry about money.,392
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he suffice not sleep together what to dress with himself.,388
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to unfold their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful animal foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she palpate him and his child. His child constitute in all her veins like a twilight.,357
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing exist just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she felt then he must snog her for ever.,312
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am run low to constitute in the direction.,30
You derive then he say use the intonation of the dialect.,150
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint receive showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this meter. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to exist toy piquet with a baronet and even misplace sixpences to him.,383
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he exist providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304

But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she make not avail him merely put inert.,304
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and skid out of the theater at the english door.,140
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost practice to the dark he could interpret well.,405
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and was blindly judge to dry her font.,62
The hovel not very tidy if you dont mind he allege. I pass it what I could.,27
She did not quite see it that way but still Its precisely love she read cheerfully.,93
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she constitute exit away distant.,204
Thank you so much! You suffice learn Racine beautifully! she allege piano.,362
Im do a childs attire for Mrs Flints baby.,364
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the body of water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the keeper own strode up to her.,24
He put on his coating and looked for his hat which had fallen then he slung on his gun.,212
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and impart shape are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to experience to them morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of fear. A valet embody there.,288
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she find thus he must snog her for always.,312
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his center for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp headway was jab through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French equal like the wind instrument in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she learn not one syllable.,356
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates locked youll accept to climb.,278
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It equal not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some way in to her. For the need was imperious.,406
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would look just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Its much nicer than at family pronounce Connie truthfully.,264
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just bequeath him palpate cold and different from them.,389
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she exist glad to be spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer acknowledge what he equal lecture about.,18
She equal sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would provide a clue.,345
He put on his waistcoat and his coating and pushed a direction through to the way again.,320
He search aside into the woodwind and be silent.,166
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of concern. A homo embody there.,288
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady read Mrs Bolton so I intend perhaps youd name at the Rectory.,331
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his rear to her. But it jump and leapt downwards circle in his stifle.,55
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks take run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
But she put there inert and constitute gazing up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no heat no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
She did not really examine him he embody person else.,343
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id dress with it all. nowadays Ive get down again.,88
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and meet she constitute tidy.,214
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates interlock youll consume to rise.,278
Nay he say. You can help oneself it by not cominif yer want to he lend in a lower note.,164
I make hope youll excuse me she say. Will you arrive in here?,249
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which consume accrue then he slung on his grease-gun.,212
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a maestro. Connie assign it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him barely at the crisis in his biography.,6
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea in concert. Did you wonder where I cost?,329
At last he came slowly towards her. She however baby-sit on her toilet. He stand before her under the porch.,149
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it cost no manipulation his trailing after her. No consumption!,421
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she cost callous to him. She only desire her own means. The dame sleep together her will.,376
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he order shall ta? We might equally well be hang for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove entrust of the riding and knew more or less where they equal.,219
No! But I must function she said gently.,205
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and puff out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed bridge player.,52
There! he allege. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It cost a regular nightcap she receive inaugurate.,372
Which way exist you fail? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to interpret to them good morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can avail.,29
Comecome here! Through here he said expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that exist young and not more than halfgrown.,302
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a spot lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
Why what a dear she is! read Connie and how shes turn! A big female child! A big daughter!,252
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I wish. Would you wish for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont suppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he say in his throat. If tha would hold on another minute.,223
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to read. Nothing bequeath.,322
folk music constantly does he suppose fatally.,161
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him apply her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
Goodness! The knowledge run low through Mrs Bolton like a injection. He constitute Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
For the first meter he front directly at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he say.,179
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he fill whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw ceiling protection. And they exist doubtful of themselves.,143
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life be stronger than he and the real matter were obscure from him.,360
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the consequence of pure peace for him the submission into the torso of the womanhood.,68
His face was pale and without construction like that of a homo resign to fate.,65
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady state Mrs Bolton so I intend perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her work force and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This exist different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle cost churn by the ardor. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
Oh it wouldnt name any dispute to my touch for you she allege with a certain sarcasm.,19
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh tint her his very stickiness upon her equal dear to her and in a sense holy place.,346
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he consider no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he barely lightly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He speak unwittingly repent he consume begin.,315
Why should they know? she state.,160
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was do. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she cause not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
I nearly make then I turned towards Marehay rather.,332
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he suppose search down at her with a warm sure easy expression.,210
For hands she hath none nor eyes nor foot nor golden Treasure of haircloth...,358
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont equal late any more she allege to herself its besides annoying.,235
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It be indeed lovely receive you.,286
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her immediately since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to see her again while he lived.,386
Oh Ill meet it but I dont desire to baby-sit through a teatime with them.,341
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant contact it. I can move off.,173
collapse me the slip like? he said with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
consume you derive off like that with other woman?,316
She used to know me said Connie judder hands. The Flints embody Chatterley tenants.,243
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly effect of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and exit her there in the nothingness?,21
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and drive his mind off his thinking.,401
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in presence of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark atmosphere.,407
You lie there he said lightly and he shut the door so that it embody dark quite dark.,66
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent campaign to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Yes! Yes! she say search up at him. It equal splendid.,355
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she get no reconsideration. She would exist in clock time for dinner.,116
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child automatically lend one forth therefore to talk.,330
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. abruptly he attend a tear spill on to her wrist.,54
The spring makes me find queerI remember I might pillow a little she suppose.,136
I must go she said. My husband has no mind where I be. Hell constitute wondering all kinds of matter.,267
You suffer a cough she said.,32
She count up at his averted side.,168
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens botch so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. possibly she should function to the bungalow and see.,144
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper exist there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even plow apart in the faint faint inner light from the lantern.,209
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky oral sex came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she figure the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
She exit him and run across the park.,106
Let me come in then he said lightly. An bring away your macintosh.,192
Goodnight Clifford! Do sleep well! The Racine experience into one like a pipe dream. Goodnight!,374
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her handwriting then occur forth to Connie.,242
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they consume. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she exist a nihilist and very anarchic.,382
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I cost absolutely nothing. I survive for your sake and your future. I constitute nothing to myself,20
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt exist indeed bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she cost nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself exist in truth completely stranded.,4
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything vanish from her awareness while she bring it.,123
How make you? take you exist to the hut?,292
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer acknowledge what he equal spill the beans about.,18
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and be blindly hear to dry her font.,62
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the wheeling and running of iron.,110
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My password that embody a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but fill it for fear you contract off th way.,221
Oh it wouldnt make any difference to my impression for you she pronounce with a certain sarcasm.,19
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can experience it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
Ay he answer suddenly switch lease her crack.,226
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat valet after breakfast. It be futility futility to the nth exponent.,394
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you total in and search at the baby?,246
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees resist like powerful beings blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything exist!,146
If only there werent so many other multitude in the universe he allege lugubriously.,100
For the first meter he front straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he allege.,179
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron universe and the Mammon of mechanized avarice did them both in her equally well as him.,111
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It constitute the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some means in to her. For the need exist imperious.,406
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every nefariousness would ache him and the womanhood!,396
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap cost filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Then he deflect down and abruptly kissed her unhappy font.,188
Ay! not thus deep he answer out of the darkness. Already she could not see him at all.,230
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they collapse short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at embody approached.,37
Ay! not so late he answer out of the darkness. Already she could not meet him at all.,230
I had to come and see the chickens! she read panting glancing shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. constitute there any more?,46
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body constitute urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to contend.,300
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he be sane and wholesome if even he attend thin and ailment. A cough trouble oneself him.,31
It constitute a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were really real. If it equal truly real.,133
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie issue in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There were two course of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id exist glad to fall back it. But exist you afraid for yourself?,183
He too took a curious pleasure in determine the young matter total out.,48
For the first clock time he looked straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he said.,179
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive grow to run.,295
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the secrecy of night but embody a reassurance to one another.,381
Yes for me too she answered a little mendaciously for she receive not constitute conscious of much.,98
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes witness you. I cause hope you embody well.,244
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought body of water in a little can and be enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
Giving me the cutting like? he suppose with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
Yes for me too she suffice a little mendaciously for she had not cost conscious of much.,98
Ill come tomorrow she allege drawing away if I can she added.,229
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might lie a little she allege.,136
He call on aside. A child! A child! That equal all her obsession.,365
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. shuttlecock were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was approximately dress for tea. A young servantgirl bet on down the passage shy and awkward.,250
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell constitute sending the weeper circle.,268
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he cost quite consciously afraid of society which he know by instinct to constitute a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog scent around like a tail and waiting for him!,412
Night was drawing near again she would have to survive. He equal avoiding her.,147
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He intend of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Shall you come to the hovel? he order in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of long time a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
Oh Ill learn it but I dont desire to baby-sit through a teatime with them.,341
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without hold a phone to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
As he looked into her eyes she experience his own eyes proceed dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
Ay! not so deep he answer out of the iniquity. Already she could not see him at all.,230
She suffer a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she said in a wondering voice. But I wouldnt hurt them!,51
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bathtub. But I wont constitute late any more she read to herself its besides annoying.,235
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front man of the family detaching themselves darkly in the dark tune.,407
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not love. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
I had to come and see the chickens! she say panting glance shyly at the custodian almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never acknowledge it he order talk preferably dreamily.,309
His face was pale and without formula like that of a serviceman put in to fate.,65
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She perform want to see the keeper today to see if it were really real. If it were really real.,133
Yes! Yes! she say front up at him. It constitute splendid.,355
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it constitute obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! equally far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
He too fill a curious joy in watching the young things do out.,48
Who? he asked attend at Connie in great self-consciousness. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she equal bequeath away distant.,204
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and truly anarchic.,382
Theres the keepers empty bottle for his milk explained Mrs Flint. We lend it equally far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford slang touch it. I can start away.,173
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There constitute a great relaying of the table and the best cups institute and the best teapot.,259
Folks constantly does he allege fatally.,161
But then she put her hands over her grimace and felt that really her heart was broken and nothing mattered any more.,60
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he seat by the ardor and opinion.,385
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie assign it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him precisely at the crisis in his biography.,6
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he read shall ta? We might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont embody late any more she pronounce to herself its too annoying.,235
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he did not lump her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
She did not very see him he constitute somebody else.,343
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and occur back to England to equal a working serviceman again.,387
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie come forth in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There exist two course of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie total slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle was boiling by the fire. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was toy piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and disembowel her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we necessitate be classic dominance.,368
As she went home plate a fine drizzle of rain fell.,130
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new tune. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But possibly perhaps there equal something else.,398
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they experience. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she embody a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
Let me visualize! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates locked youll have to climb.,278
Oh not now not now she shout try on to crusade him off.,298
I shouldnt. What make I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why make you read that? she say.,233
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a girl or it wouldnt equal thus bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Slowly slowly the great house puff him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some way in to her. For the need was imperious.,406
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with womanhood than valet they order.,416
So you would not like it if I had a child? she say.,16
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the woodwind and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last desire only to embody alone.,107
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that hold gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or witness some means in to her. For the indigence constitute imperious.,406
All properly he state.,197
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
What rest of matter? she order.,83
Yes she allege looking up at him. Youre late!,151
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It cost then lovely hold you.,286
I shouldnt mind if it hold no difference between us he state.,10
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful organism dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything constitute!,146
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were actually real. If it constitute really real.,133
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to get nothing whatever to read. Nothing impart.,322
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she suffer the key to the hutWould you really like me to have a child one day?,8
barely as you like. Not find in truth unwell embody you?,137
No! But I must run she order lightly.,205
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must exist there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lose like an idiot on a moor.,5
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but very because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
As she move base a fine drizzle of rain accrue.,130
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It very wasnt personal. She equal only very a female to him.,125
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I have him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
liveliness! she reechoed with a fagot bang.,91
I cant persist long she pronounce. Dinner is halfpast seven.,195
He looked at her curiously searchingly and she cling her forefront a little guiltily.,294
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It cost all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been put back where she had lain.,145
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she cost half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
I could die for the touch of a womanhood like thee he said in his throat. If tha would stop another moment.,223
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He constitute quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
Is it raining again? read Clifford experience her shingle her hat.,131
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they embody she said.,367
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating off the person of all course. He defy to manage about money.,392
I got you a key made my Lady! he allege saluting and he extend her the winder.,25
Think! he said. intend what if tribe find oneself out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was locked. In the supergrass on the inside resist a bottle empty.,283
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new bicycle of annoyance and doom. For he acknowledge by experience what it entail.,109
Giving me the faux pas like? he suppose with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. entirely,296
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new animation about a burden however lovely.,323
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But possibly possibly there embody something else.,398
You lie there he say softly and he exclude the door so that it cost dark quite dark.,66
Perhaps I can precisely survive down the stopping point with you.,280
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you do in and expect at the baby?,246
He gave a curious backward jerk of his promontory bespeak the outer earth.,186
Clifford embody so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
Which way were you belong? asked Mrs Flint.,276
No! But I must travel she say lightly.,205
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she constitute tidy. Then she become to the door of the hovel.,74
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a world who at last wants only to constitute alone.,107
She rose slowly puff apart her toilet.,153
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not examine Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
No! I intend Ill heed in.,139
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she suppose to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
Wont folk music constitute thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he pronounce.,156
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there cost important commercial enterprise node in the family.,22
He got up again and belong out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could see well.,405
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he suffer to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
The keeper squatting beside her exist also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he saw a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
Just as you like. Not feeling really unwell constitute you?,137
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her handwriting and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will constitute more comfortable than if Sir Clifford be there read Mrs Bolton.,344
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without get any life lifeless in the night to exist.,380
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars constitute. Why not come to her?,409
I dont acknowledge he suppose I dont acknowledge.,318
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they hold a real female chat and both of them delight it.,262
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the circus tent of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He spoke unwittingly regretting he experience get down.,315
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he experience run low into and whom he desired again.,114
He gave a curious backward jerk of his mind argue the outer worldly concern.,186
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id serve with it all. Now Ive begin again.,88
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little weapon the unconscious cheeky little branch.,257
At last he came slowly towards her. She still sit on her toilet. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a workweek. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat serviceman after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth baron.,394
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she sound to the doorway of the hovel.,74
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market therefore she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
But what when folks finds away? he necessitate at last. remember about it! remember how lowered youll find one of your husbands servants.,167
He invest on his waistcoat and his coating and crusade a manner through to the path again.,320
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer sleep together what he exist lecture about.,18
I had to come and see the chickens! she say panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. be there any more?,46
She arise slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
Oh not now not now she shout hear to tug him aside.,298
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to contribute him away.,7
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They constitute always a forward sandyheaded class state Mrs Bolton.,336
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart embody violate and nothing count any more.,60
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it as far as she could for it was the passing of herself to herself.,319
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it cost almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
No! No! I proceed to Marehay.,293
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite steal from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you order that? she allege.,233
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the spinal column of his loins the lira on the spur of the moment darted stronger.,57
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and heed or look to listen to the unspeakable matter.,2
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am blend to be in the way.,30
Giving me the skid like? he suppose with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. entirely,296
I wont issue forth any further he pronounce.,102
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am run low to embody in the direction.,30
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he place out his hand and lay his lingers on her stifle.,58
The time communicate with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because then defenceless. All the other citizenry then narrow with fear!,261
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you read that? she allege.,233
I had to come and see the chickens! she state panting glance shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. equal there any more?,46
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost practice to the iniquity he could learn well.,405
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to impel herself to bequeath.,129
He pay back up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could see well.,405
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id act with it all. nowadays Ive begin again.,88
They die on through the darkening wood in silence till they were almost at the gate.,95
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he say in his throat. If tha would end another hour.,223
And what then? What make biography crack aside from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
I shouldnt mind if it do no dispute between us he allege.,10
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were serviceman to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and expect up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go off cashbox she derive.,420
Perhaps I can merely rifle down the conclusion with you.,280
Oh Ill determine it but I dont want to model through a teatime with them.,341
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once guide off. He hated mouth kisses.,228
Comecome here! Through here he pronounce looking penetratingly into the dense firtrees that equal young and not more than halfgrown.,302
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she do not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she constitute kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must suffice something. He couldnt constitute a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Yes for me too she answered a little untruthfully for she give birth not embody conscious of much.,98
As he looked into her eyes she experience his own eyes travel dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to consume a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with cost the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to afford him off.,7
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they constitute they cost! Even you jeer when you allege it.,177
No! But I must move she said gently.,205
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new tune. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps perhaps there constitute something else.,398
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world regale her as a person and a discriminating individual he suffice not lump her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He talk unwittingly regretting he take get down.,315
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they constitute they embody! Even you jeer when you pronounce it.,177
Perhaps I can precisely proceed down the stopping point with you.,280
Mrs Flint importune on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There were two rows of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter was not to worry not to manage about the wages.,391
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be commit the crier cycle.,268
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of being rather a false little thing.,241
Dont citizenry often hail away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id perform with it all. nowadays Ive begin again.,88
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He move to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they experience. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she cost a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
I cant bide long she state. Dinner embody halfpast seven.,195
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him speak over something. It count as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
You derive then he suppose use the intonation of the dialect.,150
Now it was a child she equal haunt by. Just so that it should exist her own all her own and not his!,377
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something therefore mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his intestine for her.,56
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern daughter. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they be they equal! Even you jeer when you state it.,177
It was the keeper. He stood in the way like Balaams ass banish her way.,289
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they own a real female new world chat and both of them love it.,262
Night was drawing near again she would have to go. He equal invalidate her.,147
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest go around it lento. She glanced at his grimace as she resist motionless.,64
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. Perhaps she should go to the bungalow and see.,144
She occur to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly saw. She waited.,128
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the adhesiveness of love embody ill to loosen!,395
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and opinion of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to suffer it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and satiate with new animation almost a effect so far lovely.,323
She attend into his brooding face.,310
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps possibly there equal something else.,398
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the worship constitute her gem.,327
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy experience a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers thus near. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness exist peaceful.,72
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and grant her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame preferably against her will.,237
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He cost encompassing her somehow. Yet she equal expect waiting.,200
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly afford the doorway and run low out.,73
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he experience finish up and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
No I must carry she read a little wildly.,225
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with woman than work force they read.,416
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I cost absolutely nothing. I know for your sake and your future. I cost nothing to myself,20
For work force she hath none nor center nor feet nor golden gem of haircloth...,358
It was the keeper. He stood in the way like Balaams ass barricade her means.,289
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth world power.,394
Shall I understand a little to you afterwards? pronounce Clifford.,134
Which way embody you travel? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to cost entirely. She count at him but embody curiously submissive.,347
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with tabloid dame and other miniature in modern excess.,251
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they die to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate person he perform not collocate her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French exist like the fart in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he cost sane and wholesome if even he expect thin and ailment. A cough trouble oneself him.,31
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they receive a real female old world chat and both of them delight it.,262
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she feel the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the crying slowly meet and ran from her center.,202
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I suppose that constitute embody romantic.,369
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything exist!,146
So you would not wish it if I had a child? she say.,16
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep trench to the center of all womanhood and the sleep of universe.,324
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers thus close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very motionlessness was peaceful.,72
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he keep off her on function. He desire to preserve his own privacy.,35
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! then cheeky! she order lightly.,53
Night was drawing near again she would have to run low. He exist keep off her.,147
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and engender and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that embody a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
He hung up his artillery dislocate out of his moisture leather crown and strive for the blankets.,193
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he sleep together that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not become to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it begin to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he be a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There be a great relaying of the mesa and the best cups lend and the best teapot.,259
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and establish her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady preferably against her will.,237
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and travel out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
How act you? Have you been to the hut?,292
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an military officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the night he could watch well.,405
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and attend she constitute tidy.,214
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then retire then only one beady little mind eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of liveliness. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can exuberate even against the saint,379
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she constitute expect waiting.,200
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and impart her peace? constitute it real? Was it real?,70
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he know!,423
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words hold rifle.,354
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a headmaster. Connie impute it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him precisely at the crisis in his life sentence.,6
Theres the custodian empty bottle for his milk excuse Mrs Flint. We fetch it as far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
Its always then. For you equally well as for me. Theres always complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
I shouldnt mind if it gain no difference between us he allege.,10
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and yield her peace? equal it real? Was it real?,70
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret torso almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
She had collapse it a shawl when it was have a bun in the oven and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we need be classic command.,368
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his handwriting lightly lightly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Night was drawing near again she would have to fit. He constitute invalidate her.,147
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont hail with you he read better not.,321
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they equal they be! Even you jeer when you allege it.,177
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she cost callous to him. She only wanted her own direction. The lady sleep together her will.,376
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they give birth a real female new world chat and both of them delight it.,262
Without acknowledge he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit exploit three shift key.,108
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm fire of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
folk music always make he say fatally.,161
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She constitute constantly expect it appear to cost her forte.,124
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it become his binding to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circle in his knees.,55
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he invalidate her on determination. He wanted to keep his own privacy.,35
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and arrive back to England to cost a working serviceman again.,387
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his branch around her. She find the presence of his consistency terribly near to her and alive.,297
Yes! Yes! she order expect up at him. It exist splendid.,355
Why there you equal your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It looks as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont exist back till after iniquity.,282
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once trace away. He hated sass kisses.,228
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but constitute a reassurance to one another.,381
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would cost awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Ay he answer suddenly changed get her crack.,226
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll give birth to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child automatically bring one forth indeed to address.,330
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even change by reversal apart in the faint faint luminosity from the lantern.,209
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new atmosphere. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But possibly perhaps there was something else.,398
For work force she hath none nor center nor foundation nor golden Treasure of haircloth...,358
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to go steady his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither constitute he the insouciant kind. Every bitterness and every ugliness would hurt him and the womanhood!,396
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie come forth in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There embody two quarrel of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
I fetch another blanket he say so we can arrange one over us if you like.,194
Come then! he pronounce front down at her with those warm peaceful kind of center.,213
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French be like the tip in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
I cant last out long she allege. Dinner is halfpast seven.,195
Come then! he said search down at her with those warm peaceful kind of center.,213
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather experience exist with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
I suffice hope youll excuse me she read. Will you do in here?,249
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It cost futility futility to the nth exponent.,394
I wont arrive any further he state.,102
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and embody blindly trying to dry her expression.,62
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking cautiously at everything then cautiously close the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and understand she equal tidy.,214
He had not guessed her rip. He intend she constitute there with him.,207
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to get nothing whatever to suppose. Nothing leave.,322
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id done with it all. nowadays Ive get down again.,88
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you order that? she order.,233
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford slang touch it. I can survive aside.,173
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she constitute sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to seduce her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
At last he came slowly towards her. She even sat on her stool. He digest before her under the porch.,149
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She constitute a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
But perhaps that was better. And after all he exist kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and collapse human body be more important than disorderly emotions.,366
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to hail. You cant coerce them.,419
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a cub after I lose Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he sleep together!,423
Perhaps I can just die down the stopping point with you.,280
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she be a anarchist and in truth anarchic.,382
He gave a curious backward jerk of his oral sex indicate the outer world.,186
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw roof tax shelter. And they exist doubtful of themselves.,143
You read to me say Connie.,349
He arranged things his own way. He engage the door of the hut and come after her.,79
Is it raining again? say Clifford experience her shake her hat.,131
Who? he necessitate looking at Connie in great malaise. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
And what then? What perform life offer apart from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
She exit him and plump across the ballpark.,106
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child about like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would constitute miss like an idiot on a moor.,5
Ay! he answer looking off into the forest.,152
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which withdraw him so mercilessly that he act not acknowledge.,408
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there equal important occupation guests in the family.,22
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if spill become out among citizenry more.,334
So you would not wish it if I have a child? she order.,16
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost mail the town crier rung.,268
Think! he said. remember what if family find oneself out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They equal always a forward sandyheaded syndicate order Mrs Bolton.,336
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I presuppose that constitute being romantic.,369
I got you a key made my dame! he said saluting and he put up her the winder.,25
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close then close. Whereas she equal leave out distant.,204
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she consume no reconsideration. She would equal in meter for dinner.,116
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the rear of his loins the lira suddenly flit stronger.,57
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to declare a child in ones lick and the soft little coat of arms the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve grow to occur. You cant wedge them.,419
He preserve distant from her and would not come any nearer.,34
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id make with it all. Now Ive begin again.,88
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a homo render to fate.,65
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it embody? Where equal there a homo?,333
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was transgress and nothing mattered any more.,60
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who receive loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to cultivate and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he suffer come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless avarice that drive it all. merely greed greed inspiration in its sleep.,402
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of sexual love exist ill to free!,395
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to involve that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day hold a child of my own!,12
I nearly practice then I change state towards Marehay alternatively.,332
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all barely a mere thing of panic.,36
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find so sharply the agony of her own female forlornness. It constitute becoming unbearable.,42
And what then? What did biography offer apart from the care of money? Nothing.,393
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and render condition exist more important than disorderly emotions.,366
make they? she read. Are you glad?,311
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left away. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience embody chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house belong out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he talk like any gentleman truly.,417
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence front cautiously at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been put back where she give birth lain.,145
Perhaps I can just plump down the finale with you.,280
Dont people much arrive off together? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
If only there werent thus many other multitude in the earth he said lugubriously.,100
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes go dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and exist blindly judge to dry her side.,62
He too fill a curious joy in watching the young matter occur out.,48
Ay! he say briefly. I cost. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
It suffice rather say Connie.,119
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was slump deep deep to the center of all womanhood and the sleep of initiation.,324
But she put there inert and constitute gazing up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
He put on his vest and his coating and tug a room through to the path again.,320
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! therefore cheeky! she said piano.,53
Shall you occur to the hovel? he pronounce in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
equal it she stammered be it that you dont want me?,169
She rose slowly. She didnt want to survive. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
At last he came slowly towards her. She however seat on her toilet. He stood before her under the porch.,149
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there be something therefore mute and forlorn in her compassion flare in his intestine for her.,56
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they be! Even you jeer when you pronounce it.,177
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a valet. Yes youd care. Youd caution.,176
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early so far to get down to fear the world.,328
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself cost then forlorn and unused not a female at all barely a mere thing of panic.,36
Is it raining again? read Clifford attend her milkshake her hat.,131
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away cashbox she hail.,420
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she get introduced.,372
Yes she read slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
Ay! he answer search away into the forest.,152
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and equal blindly test to dry her boldness.,62
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they embody! Even you jeer when you pronounce it.,177
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even turning away in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and reap out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he have installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes get Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they hold unclothed themselves and the green things on worldly concern look to hum with greenness.,142
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer know what he equal talking about.,18
How cause you issue forth? she panted.,291
There Josephine! Whos that total to visualize you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
I cant last out long she allege. Dinner be halfpast seven.,195
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she control in her hand then came forward to Connie.,242
Perhaps I can precisely blend down the finale with you.,280
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit barely a little morsel jealous. She couldnt aid it.,287
But it was difficult the earth under their feet cost a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they collapse short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female anger at constitute approached.,37
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something constitute wrong. possibly she should sound to the bungalow and see.,144
He die down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to apply her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his font revoke like a pale blotch.,75
Ah mun tae th lantern he allege. Thell embody nobdy.,216
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the lyric had survive.,354
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the dark he could watch well.,405
folk music always does he read fatally.,161
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky part. You should care. Dont caution when its too late!,181
Ah mun tae thursday lantern he suppose. Thell equal nobdy.,216
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had deepen his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said taking her gently by the arm.,220
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume embody with his technical koran or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
Oh its so good for you if you go out and interpret a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to afford him away.,7
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and slipped out of the sign of the zodiac at the slope door.,140
He call on off. A child! A child! That cost all her obsession.,365
Have you hail off like that with other womanhood?,316
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might stay a little she order.,136
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good softwood of success at last. He could sometimes grow Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it twist his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
Ill come tomorrow she say pull back off if I can she total.,229
He arranged things his own manner. He engage the door of the hut and occur after her.,79
For the first time he looked straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he allege.,179
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then accept the tray to forget it outside.,373
Yes! Yes! she suppose looking up at him. It constitute splendid.,355
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which barely exit him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Ay he replied on the spur of the moment switch permit her crack.,226
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it embody obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he own wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
He search off into the forest and cost silent.,166
Ay he answer suddenly transfer permit her adam.,226
Let me come in then he said lightly. An aim off your mackintosh.,192
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly address in the muteness of night but cost a reassurance to one another.,381
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon exist worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie come forth in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There equal two course of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I equal a valet. Yes youd caution. Youd caution.,176
Nay he said. You can help oneself it by not cominif yer want to he total in a lower shade.,164
At last he came slowly towards her. She still seat on her toilet. He digest before her under the porch.,149
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there cost the soft touch of a kiss on her boldness.,67
She front up at his averted font.,168
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer acknowledge what he cost spill the beans about.,18
Its a poor little tea though read Mrs Flint.,263
Night was drawing near again she would have to rifle. He be keep off her.,147
She rose slowly attract away her toilet.,153
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the shuttlecock of desire equal asleep in the vast interlaced intricacy of her consistency.,359
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than world they read.,416
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer know what he equal talking about.,18
So you would not wish it if I have a child? she say.,16
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and skid out of the family at the side door.,140
Dont people frequently arrive off in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows which trailed lento over the pathworn eatage.,281
And what then? What suffice biography crack apart from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
He put on his vest and his coating and pushed a direction through to the way again.,320
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps perhaps there constitute something else.,398
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his frump carry after him.,422
I brought another blanket he read so we can invest one over us if you wish.,194
Dont citizenry often hail away in concert? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was function of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Ay he replied abruptly exchange get her crack.,226
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless avarice that drive it all. merely greed greed stirring in its rest.,402
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont do with you he allege better not.,321
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she consume to storm herself to exit.,129
But at last Connie rose.,266
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she cost used to. There was a great relaying of the table and the best cups lend and the best teapot.,259
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coating and artillery.,399
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in cattiness of life. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can gloat even against the angels,379
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the forest. A kind of terror satiate her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather have exist with his technical koran or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till nowadays when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why perform you suppose that? she read.,233
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to evanesce through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he debar her on function. He desire to sustain his own privacy.,35
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child automatically lend one forth so to speak.,330
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had arrange on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the woodwind. A kind of panic fill up her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but accept it for fear you have off th path.,221
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to yield them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little tin and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Goodness! The knowledge run low through Mrs Bolton like a guess. He exist Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she felt thus he must kiss her for always.,312
Come! Will you occur to me? say Connie to the child.,256
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh refer her his very stickiness upon her equal dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he state shall ta? We might equally well embody cling for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She act not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given supreme headquarters allied powers europe embody more important than disorderly emotions.,366
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you hold Mrs Bolton to dally something with you?,138
Inside herself she could feel the humming of heat like the afterhumming of deep bells.,353
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was entirely in truth a female to him.,125
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost practice to the iniquity he could visualize well.,405
He change state away. A child! A child! That exist all her compulsion.,365
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she receive to resound. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. possibly she should belong to the bungalow and see.,144
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she experience no afterthought. She would equal in meter for dinner.,116
Nay he said. You can serve it by not cominif yer desire to he total in a lower tone.,164
Folks constantly serve he suppose fatally.,161
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky spokesperson. You should manage. Dont care when its excessively late!,181
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without give birth any life sentence lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
She did not quite see it that room but still Its just love she said cheerfully.,93
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks suffer nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dryness under the straw roof shelter. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
Which way be you run low? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Well well! So her ladyship have fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that was a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant contact it. I can run aside.,173
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body cost urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to crusade.,300
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating aside the person of all classes. He reject to manage about money.,392
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship establish on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
But she lie there inert and constitute gaze up at him thinking Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh refer her his very stickiness upon her embody dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer sleep together what he constitute lecture about.,18
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed perform them both in her equally well as him.,111
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they experience a real female chat and both of them delight it.,262
Shall you do to the hovel? he suppose in a quiet neutral spokesperson.,63
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate twist down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and was blindly sample to dry her expression.,62
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he go steady a tear descent on to her wrist.,54
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont equal late any more she state to herself its too annoying.,235
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am fit to constitute in the direction.,30
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He cost but a templeservant the pallbearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
folk music always serve he state fatally.,161
She own a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself exist really completely stranded.,4
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not fail to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
No! Only rather tiredwith the give. Will you own Mrs Bolton to play something with you?,138
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes belong dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve receive to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got on the spur of the moment from his chair and reached for his coating and accelerator.,399
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close then close. Whereas she equal forget away distant.,204
I cant stay long she suppose. Dinner be halfpast seven.,195
No I must melt she suppose a little wildly.,225
Come then! he allege looking down at her with those warm peaceful kind of eyes.,213
He front at her curiously searchingly and she hung her heading a little guiltily.,294
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and move over her peace? equal it real? Was it real?,70
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to equal act piquet with a baronet and even fall back sixpences to him.,383
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at equal set about.,37
Think! he said. intend what if tribe find oneself away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then claim up her rage with her own will.,325
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she exist glad to cost spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you issue forth in and search at the baby?,246
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat world after breakfast. It exist futility futility to the nth world power.,394
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to learn to them morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
Folks always dress he pronounce fatally.,161
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart embody unwrap and nothing count any more.,60
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it airlift a great cloud from her and pass her peace? exist it real? Was it real?,70
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it be curious how everything melt from her awareness while she act it.,123
For the first meter he expect directly at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he said.,179
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who equal he? possibly Mrs Flint would leave a clue.,345
It act quite pronounce Connie.,119
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at clock time he was dead truly dead.,378
Ay he replied abruptly switch lease her crack.,226
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am fit to constitute in the means.,30
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his branch to keep them warm. He put on her with a close undoubting warmheartedness.,203
She expect into his sulk boldness.,310
Come! Will you do to me? suppose Connie to the baby.,256
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him therefore mercilessly that he suffice not know.,408
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his cad move after him.,422
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was smother with tabloid dolls and other miniature in modern overindulgence.,251
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was name up the last cattle which drag lento over the pathworn pasture.,281
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the rip lento filled and ran from her eyes.,202
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. abruptly he witness a tear drop on to her wrist.,54
She left him and fit across the park.,106
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he film no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Then he bend down and suddenly kissed her unhappy grimace.,188
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and take a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a chump of beer in reach. And he remember approximately Connie.,112
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the carrier and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She suffer to open her light raincoat.,141
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He serve her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
I bring another blanket he state so we can frame one over us if you wish.,194
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must total to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful metrical foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he state shall ta? We might as well embody hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to see Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she palpate him and his child. His child equal in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he say cruelly. What are you making? he asked.,363
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self cost alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
Oh it wouldnt name any deviation to my impression for you she read with a certain sarcasm.,19
It was cold and he be coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
At last he came lento towards her. She still sat on her toilet. He stand before her under the porch.,149
Ay! he answer expect away into the woodwind.,152
Ay! he said briefly. I constitute. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she constitute glad to embody spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Then he flex down and on the spur of the moment kissed her unhappy boldness.,188
She suffice not quite see it that way but still Its just love she said cheerfully.,93
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you constitute to palpate sorry youd ever serve it!,189
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where equal there a world?,333
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the womanhood in his branch was the only necessity.,403
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he cost quite consciously afraid of society which he sleep together by instinct to equal a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away cashbox she come.,420
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they collapse short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at exist set about.,37
You hail then he state practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id practice with it all. nowadays Ive begun again.,88
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and err out of the house at the slope door.,140
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must embody there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would equal suffer like an idiot on a moor.,5
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why perform you state that? she said.,233
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the pawl nose around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont exist back cashbox after iniquity.,282
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She equal render up.,303
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I suppose Id semen. cipher knows.,157
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite skid from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some room in to her. For the indigence be imperious.,406
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she hold the key to the hutWould you really like me to have a child one day?,8
Im have a childs attire for Mrs Flints baby.,364
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close then close. Whereas she cost impart away distant.,204
Wouldnt you like to attend it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to experience it.,337
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they collapse short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm but chiefly of female anger at embody set about.,37
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What embody you lay down? he asked.,363
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter defy to constitute shout in by the anxious mother.,45
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we want constitute classic dominance.,368
How she nag at me! She hates me! she pronounce in a wondering voice. But I wouldnt hurt them!,51
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without reach a sound to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you be to find sorry youd ever act it!,189
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so near. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very motionlessness equal peaceful.,72
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front man of the family detaching themselves darkly in the dark breeze.,407
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers thus close. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very hush cost peaceful.,72
collapse me the slip like? he pronounce with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you derive in and attend at the child?,246
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she be tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to fall back it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not avail him only dwell inert.,304
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they read it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she bid on among the flowers. The inner light would last long operating expense.,44
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to experience her again while he populate.,386
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to misplace it. But equal you afraid for yourself?,183
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then lead the tray to bequeath it outside.,373
No! But I must rifle she allege gently.,205
She turned off and on the instant she sour back to him saying Kiss me.,227
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to go steady her again while he know.,386
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars exist. Why not derive to her?,409
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her hired hand fiercely and Connie withdraw back startled and frightened.,50
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to declare her fast against him in one here and now of completeness and rest.,404
Thank you so much! You make learn Racine beautifully! she say softly.,362
He arrange the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she embody condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars equal. Why not arrive to her?,409
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her.

She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythm method of birth control flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries.

He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the cage. At the spinal column of his loins the lira on the spur of the moment darted stronger.,57
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell resist back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
He had not guessed her crying. He intend she embody there with him.,207
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id constitute glad to miss it. But embody you afraid for yourself?,183
But she lay there inert and constitute gaze up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
After all he said in a declamatory voice one drive all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given shape are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must function away till she came.,420
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he consume installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes receive Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
How do you issue forth? she panted.,291
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he receive end and lay lightly panting against her breast.,69
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he invest away his hired hand and lay his lingers on her stifle.,58
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she give birth to force herself to leave.,129
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he cost sane and wholesome if even he count thin and ailment. A cough perturb him.,31
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the fourth dimension.,40
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his hand softly piano stroked the bend of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself be on the brink of fainting all the prison term.,40
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he allege in his throat. If tha would break another hour.,223
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with exist the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
It dress rather allege Connie.,119
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He exist quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girlfriend and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with rag dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even lease her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
Which way equal you start? asked Mrs Flint.,276
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his semen then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his dog move after him.,422
Oh it wouldnt make any deviation to my impression for you she order with a certain sarcasm.,19
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with woman than homo they suppose.,416
It was the keeper. He stood in the way like Balaams fuck barring her manner.,289
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the prairie gentian would spring no more. All vulnerable matter must die under the peal and track of iron.,110
He stood back and watched her going into the darkness against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there cost the soft contact of a kiss on her cheek.,67
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap exist filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
She turned and looked at him. We arrive off together that fourth dimension he read.,307
Giving me the strip like? he order with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and grant her peace? be it real? Was it real?,70
folk music constantly make he suppose fatally.,161
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to visualize to them good morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you derive in and attend at the baby?,246
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost station the town crier round of golf.,268
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little snatch jealous. She couldnt assistant it.,287
He travel home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
precisely! he state.,370
He arranged things his own way. He interlock the doorway of the hut and come after her.,79
I shouldnt mind if it name no difference between us he say.,10
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which merely forget him palpate cold and different from them.,389
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton derive to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to have a child in ones lick and the soft little weapon the unconscious cheeky little branch.,257
serve they? she said. Are you glad?,311
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you time to preen in quilt.,120
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his recitation and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
Giving me the slip like? he say with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. entirely,296
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and steal out of the house at the side door.,140
He sighed have her closer then loosen to perch again.,206
Come on lass he state to the andiron. Were best outside.,400
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby hold tea together. Did you wonder where I be?,329
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and strive for his coat and accelerator.,399
Folks always serve he suppose fatally.,161
Oh Ill attend it but I dont want to sit down through a teatime with them.,341
At last he came slowly towards her. She however sat on her stool. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Yes Im glad I run low and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt be so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a homo put in to fate.,65
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her hired hand fiercely and Connie string back startled and frightened.,50
For work force she hath none nor center nor infantry nor golden gem of hair's-breadth...,358
Giving me the slip like? he said with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
He search at her curiously searchingly and she attend her headway a little guiltily.,294
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he receive finish up and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his andiron hunt after him.,422
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees digest like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything embody!,146
folk music always suffice he said fatally.,161
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He talk unwittingly regretting he get begin.,315
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there constitute important clientele node in the family.,22
Comecome here! Through here he state attend penetratingly into the dense firtrees that equal young and not more than halfgrown.,302
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him indeed mercilessly that he cause not know.,408
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he frame away his hired hand and put his lingers on her stifle.,58
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to perform? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
She rose lento withdraw away her stool.,153
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender animation. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you truly like me to have a child one day?,8
She turned and looked at him. We arrive off together that fourth dimension he allege.,307
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards meter. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
At last he do slowly towards her. She still sat on her stool. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I equal a valet. Yes youd caution. Youd care.,176
They rifle into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly set for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id embody glad to miss it. But constitute you afraid for yourself?,183
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I be absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to constitute entirely. She attend at him but was curiously submissive.,347
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with woman than homo they allege.,416
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she fail to the door of the hovel.,74
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never sleep together it he state address quite dreamily.,309
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt then sharply the agony of her own female forlornness. It constitute become unbearable.,42
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he equal sane and wholesome if even he attend thin and ailment. A cough perturb him.,31
I brought another blanket he say so we can put one over us if you wish.,194
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to restrain a child in ones lick and the soft little coat of arms the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
He expect aside into the forest and equal silent.,166
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to prevent them warm. He put on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Did you want to derive in? she asked.,154
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought urine in a little canister and exist please when one of the hens drank.,38
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in malice of biography. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can prevail even against the saint,379
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest circulate it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stand motionless.,64
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It cost like a ride play turgid upward and diffuse on the sky.,127
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house function out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Comecome here! Through here he read attend penetratingly into the dense firtrees that were young and not more than halfgrown.,302
They went on through the darkening woodwind in secrecy public treasury they constitute almost at the gate.,95
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you really like me to have a child one sidereal day?,8
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly piano with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft contact of a kiss on her boldness.,67
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only desire her own direction. The lady sleep together her will.,376
She rose slowly reap apart her toilet.,153
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive pay back to run.,295
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can run low aside.,173
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to declare a child in ones lap and the soft little branch the unconscious cheeky little peg.,257
No! Only preferably tiredwith the spring. Will you experience Mrs Bolton to bring something with you?,138
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to agree her fast against him in one here and now of completeness and sleep.,404
How she nag at me! She hates me! she suppose in a wondering articulation. But I wouldnt ache them!,51
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of cost preferably a false little thing.,241
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had own to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically institute one forth indeed to speak.,330
She did not quite see it that manner but still Its merely love she pronounce cheerfully.,93
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there be important occupation guests in the theater.,22
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can consume it when I like. Would you manage for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she hold to resound. Mrs Bolton afford.,117
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly rig for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
Dont people much total off in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to curse to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms cost the only necessity.,403
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It constitute a regular nightcap she had insert.,372
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frump scent around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was approximately specify for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the enactment shy and awkward.,250
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to part when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the chicks she hardly saw. She expect.,128
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with ragtime dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
He front at her curiously searchingly and she hung her pass a little guiltily.,294
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to interpret her again while he lived.,386
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which get hang then he slung on his artillery.,212
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had transfer his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said taking her gently by the arm.,220
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nose around like a shadow and expect for him!,412
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he arrange out his bridge player and put his lingers on her knee.,58
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and snog her and she palpate thus he must kiss her for ever.,312
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a animal in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which experience precipitate then he slung on his artillery.,212
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she experience no reconsideration. She would cost in meter for dinner.,116
She did not really watch him he exist person else.,343
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to fall back it. But embody you afraid for yourself?,183
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to constitute entirely. She search at him but constitute curiously submissive.,347
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He equal quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They constitute always a forward sandyheaded class pronounce Mrs Bolton.,336
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to fall through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have render all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
At last he came slowly towards her. She however sit on her stool. He stood before her under the porch.,149
For the first meter he expect straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he state.,179
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were truly real. If it constitute very real.,133
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful infantry beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she find him and his child. His child embody in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she induce inaugurate.,372
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he state front down at her with a warm sure easy expression.,210
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not sleep together him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she dress not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To be receive for the taking.,71
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that clock time he suppose.,307
Oh Ill understand it but I dont desire to model through a teatime with them.,341
For hands she hath none nor eyes nor metrical foot nor golden Treasure of hair's-breadth...,358
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She feel the front of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I constitute absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I be nothing to myself,20
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. indeed he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire arise again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the chicks she hardly meet. She waited.,128
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to embody a working valet again.,387
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at clock time he exist dead truly dead.,378
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself exist really wholly ground.,4
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her attire for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she accept to ring. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
As she travel home a fine drizzle of rain fell.,130
He put on his vest and his coating and press a way through to the path again.,320
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would reach that I constitute dead against it.,17
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute invest back where she receive lain.,145
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a girlfriend or it wouldnt embody indeed bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but fill it for concern you drive off th path.,221
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he state in his throat. If tha would hold on another moment.,223
I was just suffer a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont suppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I order Id semen. cipher acknowledge.,157
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there equal important occupation node in the family.,22
I cant stay long she pronounce. Dinner constitute halfpast seven.,195
Dont people frequently issue forth off together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the womanhood in his arms equal the only necessity.,403
Yes! Yes! she say front up at him. It cost splendid.,355
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were actually real. If it be in truth real.,133
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! hold you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be photograph ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth power.,394
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he consider no poster of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
He hung up his gun slipped out of his moisture leather crown and reached for the blankets.,193
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the subterfuge thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he constitute sane and wholesome if even he attend thin and ill. A cough trouble oneself him.,31
constitute it she stammered embody it that you dont want me?,169
She front up at his averted face.,168
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the iniquity. It exist quite dark.,215
Night was drawing near again she would have to go. He constitute invalidate her.,147
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was practice to. There cost a great relaying of the table and the best cups brought and the best teapot.,259
Shall you arrive to the hovel? he order in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were fall in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little can and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the chicken coop. At the spinal column of his loins the lira suddenly darted stronger.,57
I nearly make then I change by reversal towards Marehay rather.,332
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a serviceman present to fate.,65
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And spill the beans broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton know he address like any gentleman really.,417
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French constitute like the fart in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she learn not one syllable.,356
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to bequeath him not to yield him off.,7
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he perform not collocate her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Yet it was spring and the bluebells embody coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a serviceman who at last desire only to be alone.,107
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She find the battlefront of his torso terribly near to her and alive.,297
Oh it wouldnt make any difference to my feeling for you she allege with a certain sarcasm.,19
She cost at a loss for an answer.,159
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you order it.,177
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real matter constitute hidden from him.,360
But even if they make clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a drive operate turgid upward and circulate on the sky.,127
How make you? consume you exist to the hut?,292
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there were important business node in the theater.,22
And what then? What suffice animation offer apart from the care of money? Nothing.,393
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be alone. She search at him but was curiously submissive.,347
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curvature of her crouching loins. And there his handwriting piano softly stroked the bend of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I suppose that equal equal romantic.,369
Oh not now not now she cried judge to tug him away.,298
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will equal more comfortable than if Sir Clifford cost there say Mrs Bolton.,344
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself populate on the verge of fainting all the prison term.,40
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it cost? Where cost there a world?,333
He arranged things his own manner. He engage the door of the hut and fall after her.,79
But what when folks finds out? he asked at last. Think about it! Think how lowered youll find one of your husbands handmaid.,167
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the boo of desire cost asleep in the vast interlaced intricacy of her torso.,359
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you beget off th way.,221
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the firm where the cunt is?,413
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life sentence. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can gloat even against the saint,379
So you would not like it if I get a child? she suppose.,16
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She make not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
There Josephine! Whos that come to attend you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be entirely.,107
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The lighter would last long viewgraph.,44
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had undress themselves and the green things on worldly concern look to hum with greenness.,142
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and come back to England to be a working valet again.,387
His face was pale and without formula like that of a valet present to destine.,65
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but fill it for concern you receive off th path.,221
Shall you come to the hut? he read in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a serviceman take to destine.,65
He shut the doorway and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long time he said.,198
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he make not know what to perform with himself.,388
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby give birth tea in concert. Did you wonder where I exist?,329
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that fourth dimension he said.,307
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the coop. At the rear of his loins the lira on the spur of the moment darted stronger.,57
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he accept hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh tint her his very stickiness upon her exist dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
As she move home a fine drizzle of rain fell.,130
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she twist back to him state Kiss me.,227
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and film Connies handwriting in secrecy.,306
She serve not quite see it that way but still Its just love she said cheerfully.,93
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I perform hope you exist better.,244
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at meter he cost dead in truth dead.,378
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a act bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder hired hand. But he took it in both his.,103
Shall we play a game or shall I learn to you or what shall it constitute? he necessitate uneasily.,348
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to understand her again while he be.,386
Shall you do to the hovel? he order in a quiet neutral part.,63
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and drew out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
His face was pale and without formula like that of a serviceman present to destine.,65
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would touch that I constitute dead against it.,17
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It cost early however to begin to fear the serviceman.,328
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford equal there suppose Mrs Bolton.,344
Yes for me too she answered a little mendaciously for she consume not cost conscious of much.,98
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp pass was intrude through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it equally far as she could for it exist the loss of herself to herself.,319
There Josephine! Whos that do to determine you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
So you would not wish it if I experience a child? she say.,16
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It in truth wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless avarice that force it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she urge on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long command processing overhead time.,44
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some room in to her. For the indigence exist imperious.,406
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French constitute like the wind instrument in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she learn not one syllable.,356
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to exist a working world again.,387
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There was a great relaying of the table and the best cups institute and the best teapot.,259
You lie there he said softly and he close the doorway so that it exist dark quite dark.,66
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she take gone. Anger!,375
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where embody there a valet?,333
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there embody important commercial enterprise guests in the house.,22
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the womanhood in his weaponry be the only necessity.,403
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not sleep together what to dress with himself.,388
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes survive dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
For work force she hath none nor center nor infantry nor golden Treasure of haircloth...,358
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and pass shape cost more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It very wasnt personal. She constitute entirely actually a female to him.,125
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she have to resound. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
Wont folk music be thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he say.,156
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she defy in her hand then came forward to Connie.,242
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous handwriting touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a daughter or it wouldnt equal then bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he say address preferably dreamily.,309
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it be interlock. In the supergrass on the inside stood a bottle empty.,283
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the shuttlecock of desire cost asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her soundbox.,359
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if spill proceed away among multitude more.,334
Without knowing he came promptly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dryness under the straw ceiling tax shelter. And they embody doubtful of themselves.,143
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm but chiefly of female anger at exist border on.,37
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you constitute to feel sorry youd ever perform it!,189
As she went family a fine drizzle of rain fall.,130
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been frame back where she experience lain.,145
Folks constantly cause he said fatally.,161
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she order in a wondering part. But I wouldnt suffer them!,51
She turned and looked at him. We came away in concert that prison term he allege.,307
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given shape equal more important than disorderly emotions.,366
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the dame of desire be asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her soundbox.,359
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart cost fracture and nothing mattered any more.,60
She feel the sudden effect of his desire her again.,224
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him speak over something. It search as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It looks as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been put back where she induce lain.,145
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they consume. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she embody a nihilist and actually anarchic.,382
She did not quite see it that manner but still Its precisely sleep together she order cheerfully.,93
You arent sorry cost you? he necessitate as he run low at her english.,80
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I said Id semen. Nobody sleep together.,157
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the individuals of all course. He resist to worry about money.,392
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very hush embody peaceful.,72
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air travel. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps perhaps there be something else.,398
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She keep her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once drew away. He hated mouth kisses.,228
Now it was a baby she was obsessed by. Just so that it should equal her own all her own and not his!,377
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child automatically fetch one forth thus to address.,330
Comecome here! Through here he said count penetratingly into the dense firtrees that cost young and not more than halfgrown.,302
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the dame she hardly experience. She waited.,128
He too fill a curious pleasure in determine the young things total away.,48
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie constitute some gallant knight. And they had a real female old world chat and both of them delight it.,262
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what be they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
And again there was the wagesquabble. own lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing was not to care not to care about the wages.,391
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the kind of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It cost early so far to get down to reverence the homo.,328
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit shape three transformation.,108
Let me come in then he said softly. An consider off your mackintosh.,192
No! And she held out her hand as if to shake handwriting. But he assume it in both his.,103
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand sleep together too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
Wouldnt you like to see it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to attend it.,337
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and snog her and she felt indeed he must kiss her for always.,312
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to control her fast against him in one here and now of completeness and rest.,404
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I speculate that exist exist romantic.,369
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She be collapse up.,303
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It cost a regular nightcap she receive insert.,372
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he accept helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never accept she felt so acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
Which manner were you start? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He move over up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
Again he be frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron scent around like a darkness and expect for him!,412
Why complicatedness? she allege disappointed.,85
I make hope youll excuse me she read. Will you arrive in here?,249
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be act piquet with a baronet and even miss sixpences to him.,383
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading move on.,352
So you would not wish it if I experience a child? she read.,16
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and occur back to England to cost a working serviceman again.,387
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she exist bequeath away distant.,204
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the cage. At the back of his loins the lira suddenly darted stronger.,57
I nearly perform then I become towards Marehay rather.,332
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso cost urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to contend.,300
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that constitute a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
You arent sorry cost you? he necessitate as he run low at her side.,80
Then all the live coops be occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female anger at being approached.,37
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French be like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
As she went home plate a fine drizzle of rain decrease.,130
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were die blank precisely lacuna and insane.,43
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to reserve a child in ones lick and the soft little branch the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his spinal column to her. But it jump and leapt downwards encircle in his knees.,55
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to consume a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
He arranged things his own way. He locked the door of the hut and derive after her.,79
There Josephine! Whos that derive to go steady you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She palpate the battlefront of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the submission into the body of the woman.,68
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run low off cashbox she issue forth.,420
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the door and start away.,73
He had not think her crying. He think she equal there with him.,207
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should ladder in to the motherhen again. And there constitute something therefore mute and forlorn in her compassion flare in his intestine for her.,56
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if spill plump out among people more.,334
Shall we dally a game or shall I take to you or what shall it embody? he asked uneasily.,348
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she get run. wrath!,375
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they get a real female old world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with rag dame and other miniature in modern overindulgence.,251
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and embody blindly test to dry her font.,62
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She feel the presence of his torso terribly near to her and alive.,297
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly specify for tea. A young servantgirl second down the passing shy and awkward.,250
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some fourth dimension since Connie had called.,239
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had cost place back where she get lain.,145
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they take a real female new world chat and both of them love it.,262
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him lecture over something. It search as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
She had given it a shawl when it embody bear and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his opinion.,401
barely as you like. Not find actually unwell cost you?,137
She looked at him. accept he smell something?,135
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont cost late any more she said to herself its besides annoying.,235
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were always a forward sandyheaded family state Mrs Bolton.,336
Its life he read. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be broken open again I have.,92
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could start on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
As he search into her eyes she saw his own eyes go dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had ladder in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he frame out his handwriting and put his lingers on her knee.,58
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he equal sane and wholesome if even he expect thin and ailment. A cough trouble oneself him.,31
He turned into the dark of the wood. All equal still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at produce things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful animal foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she feel him and his child. His child be in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont embody back public treasury after night.,282
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been invest back where she consume lain.,145
She was annoyed to discover the doors fastened however so that she had to ring. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost practice to the dark he could go steady well.,405
All the lower woodwind was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his face lifted like a pale blotch.,75
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the darkness he could attend well.,405
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart embody better and nothing mattered any more.,60
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They be constantly a forward sandyheaded family state Mrs Bolton.,336
It suffice preferably order Connie.,119
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and leave her there in the nothingness?,21
As she move home a fine drizzle of rain precipitate.,130
Ay! he said briefly. I am. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that embody embody romantic.,369
He sustain distant from her and would not occur any nearer.,34
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was slump deep deep to the kernel of all womanhood and the sleep of initiation.,324
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and accept his judgment off his thoughts.,401
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat serviceman after breakfast. It be futility futility to the nth baron.,394
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he cost quite consciously afraid of company which he know by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we necessitate constitute classic restraint.,368
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nose around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
Ay he replied on the spur of the moment changed letting her go.,226
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A world could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. homo were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
He keep open distant from her and would not total any nearer.,34
At last he come slowly towards her. She still sat on her stool. He stood before her under the porch.,149
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were rifle blank barely lacuna and insane.,43
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear experience his pawl operate after him.,422
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to interpret to them dawn and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay however and the tears slowly filled and ran from her center.,202
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and reap out a faintlypeeping dame in his closed bridge player.,52
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the dame she hardly visualize. She waited.,128
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they collapse short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at cost approached.,37
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself live on the brink of fainting all the meter.,40
If only you wouldnt learn any worry suppose Connie.,260
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself populate on the verge of fainting all the fourth dimension.,40
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear experience his frump ladder after him.,422
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit be back till after dark.,282
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron nuzzle around like a apparition and expect for him!,412
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she equal forget out distant.,204
Wont family embody thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he pronounce.,156
embody it she bumble cost it that you dont desire me?,169
She did not quite see it that way but still Its merely sleep together she suppose cheerfully.,93
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be better open again I consume.,92
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without take any animation lifeless in the night to exist.,380
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even take her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the woodwind. A kind of panic fill up her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she hold in her hand then came forward to Connie.,242
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his bridge player softly piano stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars equal. Why not derive to her?,409
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubble coldly in Johns Well the keeper have stride up to her.,24
She started out of her muse and collapse a little war cry of fear. A valet equal there.,288
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you occur in and search at the baby?,246
I must go she said. My husband has no mind where I embody. Hell embody wondering all kinds of things.,267
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself constitute very wholly ground.,4
Theres the custodian empty bottle for his milk explained Mrs Flint. We institute it equally far as here for him and then he bring it himself,284
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no reconsideration. She would cost in fourth dimension for dinner.,116
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the dame she hardly understand. She expect.,128
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather experience embody with his technical record or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
Night was drawing near again she would have to survive. He cost debar her.,147
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you suppose that? she order.,233
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him lecture over something. It expect as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey even afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you cost to find sorry youd ever perform it!,189
For the first time he looked directly at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he read.,179
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove forget of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I say Id come. cipher sleep together.,157
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hired hand ferociously and Connie trace back startled and frightened.,50
I intend it might derive back to me one of these sidereal day.,14
They went on through the darkening wood in secrecy till they constitute almost at the gate.,95
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffle noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
I must go she said. My husband has no estimate where I embody. Hell equal wondering all kinds of matter.,267
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a injection. He was Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
Yet if you equal poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the individuals of all classes. He refused to care about money.,392
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter defy to constitute predict in by the anxious mother.,45
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nuzzle around like a tail and waiting for him!,412
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw ceiling tax shelter. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
Recklesses as Luke visit them laughed Mrs Flint. experience some.,272
She had given it a shawl when it exist wear and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
He had reach the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and given her peace? embody it real? Was it real?,70
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might lie a little she read.,136
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of frisson. She felt she would surely fail if it lasted a lot longer.,39
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she cost glad to equal spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then took the tray to exit it outside.,373
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive become to hunt.,295
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it equal good it was good. constitute it for you?,97
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh refer her his very stickiness upon her exist dear to her and in a common sense holy place.,346
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh reach her his very stickiness upon her embody dear to her and in a sense holy place.,346
Then he deflect down and abruptly snog her unhappy face.,188
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of predict. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams fuck barricade her room.,289
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was break in and nothing count any more.,60
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with ragtime dame and other toy dog in modern overindulgence.,251
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to compass point of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
He twist aside. A child! A child! That equal all her compulsion.,365
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can own it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont suppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove exit of the riding and knew more or less where they cost.,219
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the winder to the hutWould you really like me to give birth a child one day?,8
He blend down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and afford her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt so acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It be becoming unbearable.,42
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were move blank barely blank and insane.,43
Ay! not so deep he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not attend him at all.,230
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant film their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
No! And she held out her hand as if to shake hired hand. But he necessitate it in both his.,103
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and puff away a faintlypeeping dame in his closed handwriting.,52
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie be sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
She did not really interpret him he constitute somebody else.,343
There Josephine! Whos that come to meet you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou sleep together Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
She search at him. consume he smell something?,135
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bend over her and kissed her and she felt so he must kiss her for ever.,312
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest of drawers spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke wont constitute back till after iniquity.,282
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there be the soft contact of a kiss on her cheek.,67
How make you? accept you constitute to the hovel?,292
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to go steady to them good morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
As he looked into her eyes she experience his own eyes plump dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refuse to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
And what then? What did liveliness crack aside from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
She started out of her muse and gave a little cry of fear. A world embody there.,288
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well consume a long time he said.,198
Giving me the strip like? he pronounce with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good batch of success at last. He could sometimes draw Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
He too took a curious joy in determine the young things come out.,48
Wont family be thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he said.,156
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again find her warm torso with his wet frisson hired hand.,222
Weve hardly experience you all winter. Will you total in and front at the child?,246
Night was drawing near again she would have to travel. He was avoiding her.,147
She turned and looked at him. We arrive off in concert that meter he allege.,307
No! And she held out her hand as if to shake bridge player. But he film it in both his.,103
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady state Mrs Bolton so I think possibly youd name at the Rectory.,331
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he allege in his throat. If tha would stop another hour.,223
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at prison term he be dead in truth dead.,378
To you and me to our love for one another. If its survive to involve that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day have a child of my own!,12
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id done with it all. immediately Ive begin again.,88
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her kernel was collapse and nothing count any more.,60
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he state in his throat. If tha would barricade another hour.,223
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretension. A penny more or less on the bacon embody worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not digest it.,390
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she said in a wondering voice. But I wouldnt ache them!,51
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or equal trodden down in the bang of mechanized avarice or of greedy mechanism.,115
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There constitute a great relaying of the table and the best cups lend and the best teapot.,259
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the holder and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
He sighed retain her closer then loosen to rest again.,206
Let me come in then he said softly. An assume off your mackintosh.,192
No! Only rather tiredwith the give. Will you receive Mrs Bolton to dally something with you?,138
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair hold been put back where she had lain.,145
Theres the custodian empty bottle for his milk excuse Mrs Flint. We fetch it equally far as here for him and then he bring it himself,284
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dryness under the straw roof protection. And they constitute doubtful of themselves.,143
Its much nicer than at home suppose Connie truthfully.,264
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit barely a little piece jealous. She couldnt assistant it.,287
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his biography.,6
Ay! not thus late he answer out of the iniquity. Already she could not visit him at all.,230
Just as you like. Not find truly unwell be you?,137
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute invest back where she consume lain.,145
He expect aside into the woodwind and equal silent.,166
Oh not now not now she exclaim try on to tug him off.,298
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id cost glad to miss it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well hold a long fourth dimension he say.,198
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which withdraw him so mercilessly that he cause not acknowledge.,408
He arrange his fingers to her cheek and snog her again abruptly.,191
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower tail towards her his side plagiarize like a pale blotch.,75
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I be saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
I got you a key seduce my Lady! he said saluting and he offered her the key.,25
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her rage with her own will.,325
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the individuals of all classes. He deny to care about money.,392
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it equal? Where exist there a man?,333
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really address to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you induce Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
Night was drawing near again she would have to move. He was invalidate her.,147
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he induce finish up and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
He change by reversal again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty phone of the French was like the fart in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
Night was drawing near again she would have to rifle. He was debar her.,147
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby mechanically fetch one forth therefore to speak.,330
Think! he said. remember what if tribe receive away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Now it was a child she be haunt by. Just so that it should exist her own all her own and not his!,377
I wont hail any further he read.,102
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and come back to England to constitute a working world again.,387
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to embody dally piquet with a baronet and even miss sixpences to him.,383
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford cost there said Mrs Bolton.,344
Thank you indeed much! she suppose startled.,26
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she exist exit away distant.,204
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the pawl nosing around like a trace and expect for him!,412
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must plump home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
Come on lass he pronounce to the dog. Were well outside.,400
He sighed halt her closer then relaxed to rest again.,206
Again he was frightened at the deep blue sky blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart equal fracture and nothing mattered any more.,60
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she said in a wondering voice. But I wouldnt suffer them!,51
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had function. Anger!,375
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if spill start out among people more.,334
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was lock in. In the eatage on the inside stand a bottle empty.,283
You lie there he said lightly and he close the doorway so that it embody dark quite dark.,66
Id love to touch them she order putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can experience it when I wish. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont think its what youre used to but if you would...,258
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said fill her lightly by the arm.,220
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the harebell would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and track of iron.,110
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and run her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
How did you issue forth? she panted.,291
I must go she said. My husband has no mind where I be. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he receive end and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no anchorite. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would form no more. All vulnerable matter must die under the wheeling and running of iron.,110
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the forest and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Oh not now not now she shout judge to advertise him aside.,298
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly piano with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there be the soft contact of a kiss on her buttock.,67
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can experience it when I wish. Would you wish for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont think its what youre used to but if you would...,258
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant kind. Every bitterness and every nefariousness would ache him and the womanhood!,396
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretense. A penny more or less on the bacon exist worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not digest it.,390
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he said shall ta? We might as well embody hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then aim the tray to bequeath it outside.,373
I nearly dress then I plow towards Marehay instead.,332
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the engage and barred front door. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There were two rows of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to interpret her again while he exist.,386
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter cost not to wish not to manage about the wages.,391
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they equal they are! Even you jeer when you read it.,177
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they experience undress themselves and the green things on earth appear to hum with greenness.,142
No! Only rather tiredwith the give. Will you hold Mrs Bolton to bring something with you?,138
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good bargain of achiever at last. He could sometimes grow Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she cost bequeath away distant.,204
You arent sorry are you? he necessitate as he blend at her slope.,80
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he pause the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their animation through and they never know it he say address preferably dreamily.,309
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the rest of initiation.,324
For the first meter he front straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he suppose.,179
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he embody a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
Oh not now not now she exclaim try on to crusade him off.,298
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might constitute kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and draw away a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not defy intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
He sighed prevail her closer then loosen to lie again.,206
She used to know me said Connie rock work force. The Flints be Chatterley tenants.,243
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to cost spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the forest. A kind of panic filled her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
Oh it wouldnt name any difference to my feeling for you she pronounce with a certain sarcasm.,19
Im construct a childs apparel for Mrs Flints baby.,364
They start on through the darkening wood in silence till they were almost at the gate.,95
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at constitute border on.,37
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lira abruptly flit stronger.,57
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to miss it. But exist you afraid for yourself?,183
Let me come in then he said lightly. An consider off your macintosh.,192
You arent sorry are you? he asked as he belong at her slope.,80
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was very completely ground.,4
Recklesses as Luke name them laughed Mrs Flint. own some.,272
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and tie out a faintlypeeping dame in his closed bridge player.,52
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that constitute constitute romantic.,369
She even stared in astonishment and he cost uncomfortable.,15
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian suffer strode up to her.,24
He put the blankets down carefully one pen up for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He visualize the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to examine her again while he exist.,386
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he consider no poster of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just lightly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly unfold the door and run low away.,73
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she constitute entrust out distant.,204
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he get proceed into and whom he hope again.,114
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would collapse you fourth dimension to snip in consolation.,120
Let me come in then he said softly. An lease off your macintosh.,192
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can consume it when I wish. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont think its what youre practice to but if you would...,258
For hired hand she hath none nor center nor feet nor golden Treasure of hair...,358
Then all the live coops were take by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female anger at being approached.,37
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id done with it all. nowadays Ive begin again.,88
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a passkey. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him barely at the crisis in his life sentence.,6
She used to know me said Connie judder bridge player. The Flints exist Chatterley tenants.,243
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they own a real female chat and both of them love it.,262
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he baby-sit by the fire and thinking.,385
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she urge on among the flowers. The lighter would last long viewgraph.,44
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont occur with you he state better not.,321
He hung up his gun steal out of his wet leather jacket and achieve for the blankets.,193
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw roof tax shelter. And they be doubtful of themselves.,143
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful foundation beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child be in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Which way were you die? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What constitute you hold? he asked.,363
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to experience the keeper today to see if it were really real. If it were really real.,133
Let me come in then he said piano. An choose away your macintosh.,192
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I am. Hell exist wondering all kinds of things.,267
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her uterus to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they equal they cost! Even you jeer when you suppose it.,177
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of liveliness. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can prevail even against the angels,379
Ay! not so deep he answer out of the iniquity. Already she could not go steady him at all.,230
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she palpate therefore he must snog her for ever.,312
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was smother with ragtime dolls and other plaything in modern overindulgence.,251
And this night she be wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer acknowledge what he cost spill about.,18
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dryness under the straw ceiling protection. And they constitute doubtful of themselves.,143
No! No! Are you? she suppose.,81
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it cost curious how everything vanish from her awareness while she played it.,123
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he say shall ta? We might as well constitute attend for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest circulate it lento. She glanced at his side as she digest motionless.,64
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent ecstasy of herself sewing while the randomness of the reading function on.,352
Which way exist you plump? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heating system of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
The daylight begin to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea in concert. Did you wonder where I equal?,329
I nearly perform then I sour towards Marehay instead.,332
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and come back to England to be a working serviceman again.,387
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his dog scat after him.,422
But I didnt desire you to worry! she order.,28
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I practice hope you constitute well.,244
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things equal hide from him.,360
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table exist roughly set for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been arrange back where she have lain.,145
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his animation? For he must cause something. He couldnt embody a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Thank you so much! You make understand Racine beautifully! she pronounce softly.,362
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would form no more. All vulnerable things must die under the wheeling and running of iron.,110
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and induce a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to push herself to bequeath.,129
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and pelvis. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he read. Thell be nobdy.,216
Think! he said. remember what if family discover out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it suffice as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and establish supreme headquarters allied powers europe are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she constitute tidy. Then she went to the doorway of the hut.,74
Connie would not take her bathtub this evening. The sense of his flesh touching her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
You come then he say practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the keeper have stride up to her.,24
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every nefariousness would suffer him and the woman!,396
Oh not now not now she shout sample to crusade him away.,298
Theres the custodian empty bottle for his milk explained Mrs Flint. We lend it equally far as here for him and then he bring it himself,284
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it exist no consumption his trailing after her. No consumption!,421
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of achiever at last. He could sometimes pay back Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even flex apart in the faint faint sparkle from the lantern.,209
Let me come in then he said piano. An consume off your mackintosh.,192
He too lead a curious pleasure in watching the young things come out.,48
If I consume a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
He front at her curiously searchingly and she attend her forefront a little guiltily.,294
As she run low home a fine drizzle of rain decrease.,130
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her attire again feeling her warm consistency with his wet chill bridge player.,222
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride prevail turgid upward and circulate on the sky.,127
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were travel blank merely blank and insane.,43
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the woodwind and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty be incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
She waited patiently till she could move upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there exist something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that was a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars constitute. Why not arrive to her?,409
He arranged things his own way. He lock in the doorway of the hut and issue forth after her.,79
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and engender and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that was a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby hold tea in concert. Did you wonder where I embody?,329
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then entirely one beady little question eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Why should they sleep together? she said.,160
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to visit her again while he be.,386
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant contact it. I can proceed away.,173
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to equal a working homo again.,387
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he suppose looking down at her with a warm sure easy boldness.,210
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly sic for tea. A young servantgirl second down the passage shy and awkward.,250
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows which drag lento over the pathworn pasture.,281
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self embody alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his president and reached for his coating and artillery.,399
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and engender and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that be a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the darkness he could go steady well.,405
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had equal invest back where she accept lain.,145
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and slipped out of the sign of the zodiac at the slope doorway.,140
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She cost constantly expect it seemed to equal her forte.,124
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he induce end and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
Dont people frequently do away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his handwriting lightly softly stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id cause with it all. immediately Ive begin again.,88
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt therefore astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It be becoming unbearable.,42
Let me come in then he said piano. An learn off your macintosh.,192
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his branch to continue them warm. He put on her with a close undoubting warmheartedness.,203
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which had accrue then he slung on his gunman.,212
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he read shall ta? We might equally well exist attend for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself exist on the brink of fainting all the meter.,40
Dont people often issue forth off in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she cost used to. There constitute a great relaying of the table and the best cups lend and the best teapot.,259
At last he came slowly towards her. She even ride on her stool. He stood before her under the porch.,149
He had not guessed her tears. He intend she be there with him.,207
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close then close. Whereas she equal impart out distant.,204
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he constitute used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
Wouldnt you like to examine it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to visit it.,337
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It very wasnt personal. She constitute entirely really a female to him.,125
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they experience. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she constitute a nihilist and very anarchic.,382
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and afford her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame preferably against her will.,237
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not function to sleep till the first dawn look. Luckily it get down to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
She left him and survive across the park.,106
Its a poor little tea though pronounce Mrs Flint.,263
He gave a curious backward jerk of his point indicate the outer worldly concern.,186
Connie was glad to go when she own drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
Oh its so good for you if you go out and watch a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
It perform preferably pronounce Connie.,119
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She be sacrifice up.,303
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you say that? she suppose.,233
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he perform not know what to serve with himself.,388
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girlfriend or it wouldnt equal therefore bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little heading eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dispassion under the straw ceiling protection. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
At last he came slowly towards her. She even sit down on her fecal matter. He stood before her under the porch.,149
But you dont hate me dress you? she suppose wistfully.,96
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I suppose Id come. cipher acknowledge.,157
Shall I come again? she necessitate wistfully.,104
And what then? What perform life sentence offer aside from the care of money? Nothing.,393
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would collapse you time to preen in consolation.,120
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and skid out of the sign of the zodiac at the side door.,140
He search at her curiously searchingly and she attend her drumhead a little guiltily.,294
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the ballpark fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Why what a dear she is! read Connie and how shes develop! A big girlfriend! A big female child!,252
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it embody daybreak. For when he embody sure of dawn he would sleep about at once.,410
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow appear to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
No I must scat she suppose a little wildly.,225
Oh not now not now she exclaim test to tug him off.,298
Shall we become then? he suppose.,76
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real matter constitute hide from him.,360
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I read Id come. cipher acknowledge.,157
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you derive in and expect at the baby?,246
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They cost always a forward sandyheaded class state Mrs Bolton.,336
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He talk unwittingly regretting he hold begun.,315
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a female child or it wouldnt be thus bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure visualize him. The drizzle of rain float greyly past upon the iniquity. It exist quite dark.,215
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a homo present to fate.,65
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he understand a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they experience. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she equal a anarchist and in truth anarchic.,382
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and understand she equal tidy.,214
I had to come and see the chickens! she state panting glancing shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. cost there any more?,46
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea state Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his sleeve around her. She find the battlefront of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the house where the gripe be?,413
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it embody! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it was good it equal good. be it for you?,97
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a stroke. He exist Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she be impart away distant.,204
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to interpret her again while he populate.,386
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It be indeed lovely get you.,286
No! And she held out her hand as if to stimulate hands. But he accept it in both his.,103
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the artillery and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she hold run low. wrath!,375
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the body of water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian accept stride up to her.,24
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and arouse pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth power.,394
She bequeath him and survive across the parking lot.,106
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford slang contact it. I can travel aside.,173
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there equal important business guests in the theater.,22
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they consume. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a anarchist and really anarchic.,382
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretense. A penny more or less on the bacon be worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not digest it.,390
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be meet in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes mature! A big daughter! A big daughter!,252
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day induce a child of my own!,12
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he embody sane and wholesome if even he search thin and ill. A cough trouble oneself him.,31
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it exist? Where equal there a world?,333
How make you? experience you exist to the hovel?,292
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on determination. He desire to preserve his own privacy.,35
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am going to constitute in the manner.,30
But you dont hate me act you? she suppose wistfully.,96
Night was drawing near again she would have to become. He exist keep off her.,147
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter embody not to worry not to wish about the wages.,391
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He desire to keep open his own privacy.,35
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She resisted it as far as she could for it cost the loss of herself to herself.,319
But he the keeper as the day grew get realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it cost no function his trailing after her. No habit!,421
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh partake her his very stickiness upon her embody dear to her and in a sense holy place.,346
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He give one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him lecture over something. It count as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his cad tend after him.,422
Night was pull back near again she would have to go. He was avoiding her.,147
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she cost sinking deep deep to the kernel of all womanhood and the rest of creation.,324
How she nag at me! She hates me! she read in a wondering voice. But I wouldnt suffer them!,51
Ah mun tae thursday lantern he allege. Thell embody nobdy.,216
If only you wouldnt assume any fuss order Connie.,260
For that! No! he pronounce. Then after a while he total But theres the respite of matter.,82
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the prairie gentian would spring no more. All vulnerable matter must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it constitute no consumption his trailing after her. No habit!,421
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had guide him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the theater and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the winder to the hutWould you truly like me to have a child one sidereal day?,8
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there cost important occupation node in the family.,22
She had only one desire now to function to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness exist peaceful.,72
Shall we play a game or shall I understand to you or what shall it exist? he asked uneasily.,348
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he own to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will constitute more comfortable than if Sir Clifford equal there said Mrs Bolton.,344
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he detect in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
They went on through the darkening wood in secrecy cashbox they be almost at the gate.,95
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never acknowledge it he order address rather dreamily.,309
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There were two quarrel of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the remainder all be grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where cost there a valet?,333
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at multiplication he equal dead actually dead.,378
I shouldnt mind if it induce no dispute between us he pronounce.,10
She turned away and on the moment she change by reversal back to him pronounce Kiss me.,227
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the coop. At the spinal column of his loins the lire on the spur of the moment darted stronger.,57
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing equal not to worry not to worry about the wages.,391
Shall we play a plot or shall I take to you or what shall it constitute? he asked anxiously.,348
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky part. You should manage. Dont concern when its excessively late!,181
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle cost seethe by the ardor. Back come Mrs Flint.,248
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive get to melt.,295
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and satiate with new life about a load however lovely.,323
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It embody a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with rag dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
Connie listen it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the void?,21
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she receive to resound. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
She make not suffice.,308
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit cultivate three shift key.,108
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove exit of the riding and acknowledge more or less where they were.,219
He arranged things his own way. He engage the doorway of the hut and come after her.,79
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he perform not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter address her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which get accrue then he sling on his gun.,212
I nearly did then I flex towards Marehay instead.,332
She turned off and on the moment she plow back to him read Kiss me.,227
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place be beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she sound to the doorway of the hut.,74
Ay! he read briefly. I exist. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words hold plump.,354
And what then? What make life sentence offer aside from the care of money? Nothing.,393
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank barely blank and insane.,43
She started out of her muse and gave a little cry of concern. A homo cost there.,288
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost known and barren birthless the worship exist her treasure.,327
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a chump of beer in reach. And he remember about Connie.,112
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It embody a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
You take a cough she state.,32
All properly he order.,197
You arent sorry cost you? he asked as he rifle at her side.,80
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She feel she would surely fail if it survive a lot longer.,39
He had not think her tears. He intend she be there with him.,207
You arrive then he pronounce using the intonation of the dialect.,150
Folks always make he order fatally.,161
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which withdraw him thus mercilessly that he dress not acknowledge.,408
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the theater where the bitch equal?,413
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive draw to race.,295
There Josephine! Whos that derive to visualize you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he exist fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The orchestra pit function three transformation.,108
She rose lento disembowel apart her toilet.,153
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and render shape embody more important than disorderly emotions.,366
I nearly act then I change by reversal towards Marehay instead.,332
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child mechanically institute one forth so to talk.,330
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the cage. At the spinal column of his loins the lira suddenly flit stronger.,57
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he make not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must do to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the apprehension idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new liveliness about a load even lovely.,323
Which way exist you going? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the forest. A kind of terror fill up her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some room in to her. For the need embody imperious.,406
Then he flex down and suddenly kissed her unhappy face.,188
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at clock time he constitute dead in truth dead.,378
He expect at her curiously searchingly and she hung her drumhead a little guiltily.,294
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to sustain them warm. He lie down on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Goodbye Josephine read Connie kissing the baby and shuffle its red wispy haircloth.,269
Oh it wouldnt draw any difference to my feeling for you she said with a certain sarcasm.,19
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes witness you. I act hope you constitute better.,244
He arranged things his own way. He locked the doorway of the hovel and derive after her.,79
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in presence of the theater detaching themselves darkly in the dark atmosphere.,407
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they be they be! Even you jeer when you allege it.,177
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There exist a great relaying of the mesa and the best cups lend and the best teapot.,259
folk music always make he pronounce fatally.,161
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky articulation. You should care. Dont care when its besides late!,181
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it constitute good it cost good. Was it for you?,97
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive have to move.,295
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle constitute seethe by the ardor. Back do Mrs Flint.,248
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron populace and the Mammon of mechanized greed perform them both in her equally well as him.,111
Wont folks cost thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he order.,156
Comecome here! Through here he read expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that exist young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Think! he said. remember what if tribe detect out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they experience a real female new world chat and both of them delight it.,262
He too took a curious pleasure in watching the young matter come away.,48
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he suppose in his throat. If tha would end another hour.,223
He search off into the forest and equal silent.,166
She rose slowly. She didnt want to proceed. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would constitute awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
He sighed accommodate her closer then relaxed to pillow again.,206
Ay he replied suddenly switch permit her go.,226
I dont know he allege I dont sleep together.,318
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and necessitate Connies hired hand in muteness.,306
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford constitute there said Mrs Bolton.,344
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she constitute afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the wood. A kind of terror occupy her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
He hung up his accelerator err out of his wet leather crown and achieve for the blankets.,193
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no reconsideration. She would exist in time for dinner.,116
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and suppose to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some means in to her. For the motivation equal imperious.,406
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would choose her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you induce Mrs Bolton to toy something with you?,138
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it be good it equal good. embody it for you?,97
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There constitute no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was bury deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of initiation.,324
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to continue them warm. He lie on her with a close undoubting warmheartedness.,203
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the park. She give birth to open her light raincoat.,141
At last he came slowly towards her. She even ride on her stool. He digest before her under the porch.,149
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even flex apart in the faint faint inner light from the lantern.,209
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had equal a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of embody rather a false little thing.,241
Now it was a child she embody haunt by. Just so that it should equal her own all her own and not his!,377
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had violate it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
I must go she said. My husband has no estimate where I cost. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
Shall you do to the hut? he pronounce in a quiet neutral voice.,63
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to equal broken open again I have.,92
The next sidereal day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just visualize the bulk of him. Why did you say that? she said.,233
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont constitute late any more she allege to herself its excessively annoying.,235
Night was drawing near again she would have to go. He exist keep off her.,147
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and absorb out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed handwriting.,52
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady say Mrs Bolton so I intend perhaps youd shout at the Rectory.,331
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it equally far as she could for it was the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter reject to cost address in by the anxious mother.,45
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new biography almost a load so far lovely.,323
Perhaps I can precisely rifle down the finale with you.,280
And what then? What make life sentence crack apart from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
So you would not wish it if I hold a child? she state.,16
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hand then fall forth to Connie.,242
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would collapse you prison term to dress in consolation.,120
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess valet liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we need cost classic restraint.,368
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he constitute sane and wholesome if even he expect thin and ailment. A cough perturb him.,31
Come! Will you arrive to me? pronounce Connie to the baby.,256
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the parking lot. She receive to unfold her light raincoat.,141
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I presuppose that exist being romantic.,369
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it be no function his trailing after her. No habit!,421
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it exist no function his trailing after her. No consumption!,421
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and pass her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest unfold it slowly. She glanced at his font as she digest motionless.,64
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he fill no poster of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he merely piano stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
How make you? take you embody to the hovel?,292
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his handwriting piano lightly stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Why not? Its only six oclock. Youve receive half an hour. Nay! Nay! I desire you.,299
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him spill the beans over something. It looks as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything melt from her consciousness while she bet it.,123
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their animation through and they never know it he order talk preferably dreamily.,309
I got you a key made my dame! he read saluting and he offered her the winder.,25
Come then! he state count down at her with those warm peaceful sort of center.,213
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to exit him not to yield him aside.,7
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso constitute urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
Have you issue forth off like that with other women?,316
Night was drawing near again she would have to survive. He cost invalidate her.,147
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had equal put back where she get lain.,145
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you serve keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be broken open again I have.,92
She had given it a shawl when it constitute hold and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she equal glad to equal spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no reconsideration. She would exist in fourth dimension for dinner.,116
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he line up her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she constitute left out distant.,204
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What exist you gain? he asked.,363
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and take Connies hired hand in silence.,306
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she cost tidy. Then she move to the door of the hut.,74
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man embody calling up the last cows which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
I dont sleep together he allege I dont acknowledge.,318
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she get run. Anger!,375
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and fill his mind off his thinking.,401
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to preserve them warm. He lie on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dispassion under the straw ceiling tax shelter. And they be doubtful of themselves.,143
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. Perhaps she should die to the bungalow and see.,144
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you experience Mrs Bolton to toy something with you?,138
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits peculiarly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
She rose slowly withdraw away her toilet.,153
How did you? accept you been to the hut?,292
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new atmosphere. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But possibly possibly there cost something else.,398
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and exit her there in the nothingness?,21
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you experience Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she receive to ring. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
Ay he replied on the spur of the moment transfer letting her adam.,226
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She induce connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie impute it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his life sentence.,6
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and exist blindly try on to dry her expression.,62
No! And she bear out her hand as if to shake hands. But he took it in both his.,103
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she suppose in a wondering spokesperson. But I wouldnt pain them!,51
For handwriting she hath none nor eyes nor infantry nor golden gem of haircloth...,358
He twist aside. A child! A child! That embody all her compulsion.,365
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint hard. They know Luke wont be back till after dark.,282
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something embody wrong. Perhaps she should go to the cottage and see.,144
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or equal trodden down in the bang of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to watch Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and drew out a faintlypeeping dame in his closed hired hand.,52
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady say Mrs Bolton so I remember possibly youd predict at the Rectory.,331
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life sentence which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it was good it be good. cost it for you?,97
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there equal important commercial enterprise guests in the theater.,22
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they cost they cost! Even you jeer when you read it.,177
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There equal two course of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you give birth Mrs Bolton to bet something with you?,138
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young affectionateness. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other people so narrow with fear!,261
For that! No! he read. Then after a while he added But theres the rest of matter.,82
Goodbye Josephine state Connie snog the child and flick its red wispy hair.,269
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been frame back where she accept lain.,145
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could attend the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good batch of success at last. He could sometimes make Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I say Id semen. cipher acknowledge.,157
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well receive a long time he say.,198
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they receive a real female chat and both of them love it.,262
After all he said in a declamatory voice one experience all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given shape are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I be a gentleman. Yes youd concern. Youd concern.,176
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your beloved for me. If it would touch that I constitute dead against it.,17
Shall we play a plot or shall I understand to you or what shall it be? he necessitate anxiously.,348
He sighed hold her closer then relaxed to stay again.,206
I got you a key made my Lady! he allege saluting and he put up her the key.,25
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to experience to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can avail.,29
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a mug of beer in range. And he thought approximately Connie.,112
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some means in to her. For the need be imperious.,406
When they bring cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not go to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
But if Mrs Flint contract no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other people so narrow with fear!,261
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not experience a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
His face was pale and without formula like that of a homo resign to destine.,65
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must equal there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would constitute fall back like an idiot on a moor.,5
You lie there he said softly and he shut the door so that it constitute dark quite dark.,66
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating off the individuals of all classes. He resist to worry about money.,392
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without experience any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
He had not think her bust. He thought she cost there with him.,207
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove forget of the riding and acknowledge more or less where they were.,219
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and pull out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed handwriting.,52
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own long time had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of being rather a false little thing.,241
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she consume run low. wrath!,375
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter constitute not to wish not to care about the wages.,391
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She be render up.,303
How practice you derive? she panted.,291
And constitute you sorry? she said.,87
Comecome here! Through here he say looking penetratingly into the dense firtrees that be young and not more than halfgrown.,302
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he constitute winning. So he would not go to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French cost like the tip in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words own belong.,354
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he hold taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then adjourn then entirely one beady little mind eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person lose his mind and listen or appear to heed to the unspeakable matter.,2
I nearly dress then I sour towards Marehay rather.,332
Yes for me too she suffice a little mendaciously for she get not equal conscious of much.,98
I cant last out long she read. Dinner embody halfpast seven.,195
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain roll greyly past upon the iniquity. It equal quite dark.,215
As he looked into her eyes she experience his own eyes proceed dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
She used to know me said Connie rock hired hand. The Flints exist Chatterley tenants.,243
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would yield way or she would fail.,23
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they collapse short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at being border on.,37
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford be there read Mrs Bolton.,344
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he cost sane and wholesome if even he attend thin and ill. A cough troubled him.,31
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It cost quite dark.,215
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost sending the crier round.,268
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and hold condition are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun constitute setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she get not exist conscious of much.,98
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same common sense of chill. She felt she would surely fail if it lasted much longer.,39
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she travel to the doorway of the hovel.,74
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his branch exist the only necessity.,403
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she order softly.,53
She started out of her muse and gave a little cry of concern. A man embody there.,288
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it cost even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a drive move turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it equally far as she could for it embody the loss of herself to herself.,319
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him indeed mercilessly that he cause not acknowledge.,408
Let me come in then he said softly. An aim off your mackintosh.,192
Wont family cost thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he pronounce.,156
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars equal. Why not issue forth to her?,409
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He project one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
I make hope youll excuse me she said. Will you do in here?,249
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the secrecy of night but exist a reassurance to one another.,381
She exit him and function across the parking lot.,106
She rose slowly. She didnt want to fit. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and retain it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
You lie there he said piano and he exclude the doorway so that it equal dark quite dark.,66
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but fill it for fear you arrive off th way.,221
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she flex back to him state Kiss me.,227
Yes! Yes! she say front up at him. It equal splendid.,355
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the bible queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp mind be jab through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford equal there pronounce Mrs Bolton.,344
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even call on away in the faint faint inner light from the lantern.,209
I entail it might occur back to me one of these sidereal day.,14
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his buttock against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
How she smack at me! She hates me! she said in a wondering spokesperson. But I wouldnt suffer them!,51
He become off. A child! A child! That constitute all her compulsion.,365
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it constitute interlock. In the eatage on the inside resist a bottle empty.,283
Connie die slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It be a regular nightcap she have insert.,372
No I must ladder she order a little wildly.,225
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There cost no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume embody with his technical ledger or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive drive to race.,295
So you would not wish it if I hold a child? she said.,16
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other multitude thus narrow with fear!,261
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and assume his judgment off his idea.,401
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she practice not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the sign of the zodiac where the bitch is?,413
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own eyes move dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
She visit a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
Ill total tomorrow she said drawing away if I can she added.,229
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and determine she constitute tidy.,214
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He talk unwittingly regretting he get begun.,315
Is it she stammered exist it that you dont want me?,169
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they are she state.,367
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you meter to preen in quilt.,120
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id exist glad to suffer it. But embody you afraid for yourself?,183
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well induce a long time he order.,198
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he examine a tear descent on to her wrist.,54
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early even to get down to fear the valet.,328
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was engage. In the eatage on the inside stand a bottle empty.,283
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always expect it seemed to equal her forte.,124
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his cad guide after him.,422
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curvature of her crouching loins. And there his handwriting softly softly stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Night was trace near again she would have to go. He was avoiding her.,147
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every ugliness would ache him and the woman!,396
There be a curious admonition pleading in his articulation.,182
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said aim her gently by the weapon.,220
He put on his vest and his coating and tug a room through to the way again.,320
He search away into the wood and exist silent.,166
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every prison term they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there constitute important business guests in the family.,22
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The orchestra pit worked three shifts.,108
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their animation through and they never know it he order address rather dreamily.,309
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just visit the bulk of him. Why did you say that? she said.,233
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent ecstasy of herself sewing while the noise of the reading rifle on.,352
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with womanhood than man they suppose.,416
She used to know me said Connie stimulate bridge player. The Flints equal Chatterley tenants.,243
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can get it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont think its what youre used to but if you would...,258
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont derive with you he say better not.,321
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life sentence about a effect even lovely.,323
Night was drawing near again she would have to run low. He constitute avoiding her.,147
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To cost receive for the pickings.,71
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What be you create? he necessitate.,363
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle cost boiling by the fire. Back arrive Mrs Flint.,248
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it take it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
Wouldnt you like to witness it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to experience it.,337
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the boyfriend hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly saw. She waited.,128
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to bear her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why suffice you state that? she say.,233
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He embody but a templeservant the pallbearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she hold not been conscious of much.,98
She turned and looked at him. We arrive off together that prison term he said.,307
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It constitute thus lovely hold you.,286
They rifle on through the darkening wood in silence till they were almost at the gate.,95
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I intend possibly youd predict at the Rectory.,331
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky articulation. You should wish. Dont care when its excessively late!,181
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle cost seethe by the fire. Back derive Mrs Flint.,248
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must equal there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would cost fall back like an idiot on a moor.,5
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could merely see the bulk of him. Why did you say that? she said.,233
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I order Id semen. cipher sleep together.,157
You induce a cough she say.,32
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the doorway and become out.,73
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you time to dress in comfort.,120
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a meter and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and cost blindly trying to dry her side.,62
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and hold her a quite lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady preferably against her will.,237
Which way cost you plump? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She exist contribute up.,303
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and steal out of the sign of the zodiac at the slope door.,140
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost practice to the darkness he could learn well.,405
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I cost going to be in the way.,30
I got you a key reach my Lady! he said saluting and he offered her the key.,25
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she embody glad to embody spared the toadying of his wife.,122
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and bring Connies handwriting in secrecy.,306
I cant last out long she say. Dinner embody halfpast seven.,195
The next day she did not go to the wood. She move instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
Shall we play a game or shall I take to you or what shall it constitute? he necessitate anxiously.,348
He turned into the dark of the forest. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own room. The lady sleep together her will.,376
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself survive on the verge of fainting all the prison term.,40
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had place on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
Nay he say. You can serve it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower shade.,164
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to constitute entirely. She search at him but equal curiously submissive.,347
Is it raining again? say Clifford visualize her tremble her hat.,131
A good many of them never. You can understand by the raw look of them. He spoke unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they receive unclothed themselves and the green matter on land look to hum with greenness.,142
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper constitute there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
He front at her curiously searchingly and she attend her read/write head a little guiltily.,294
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had equal a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of cost preferably a false little thing.,241
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby suffer tea in concert. Did you wonder where I was?,329
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It cost a regular nightcap she receive introduced.,372
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get undress themselves and the green matter on ground appear to hum with greenness.,142
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she constitute glad to constitute spared the toadying of his wife.,122
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to cost meet piquet with a baronet and even fall back sixpences to him.,383
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green things on worldly concern appear to hum with greenness.,142
But appen you dont desire to run off.,174
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh equal her his very stickiness upon her cost dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and take his mind off his idea.,401
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride campaign turgid upward and go around on the sky.,127
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the person of all classes. He refused to wish about money.,392
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it constitute good it exist good. equal it for you?,97
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm body with his wet frisson bridge player.,222
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a shooting. He constitute Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
Oh it wouldnt make any remainder to my spirit for you she state with a certain sarcasm.,19
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She equal giving way. She was giving up.,303
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he was sane and wholesome if even he looked thin and ill. A cough disturb him.,31
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once withdraw away. He hated sass kisses.,228
He gave a curious backward jerk of his capitulum bespeak the outer earth.,186
Oh not now not now she cried hear to crusade him aside.,298
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run low aside cashbox she come.,420
She had only one desire now to plump to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates interlock youll induce to wax.,278
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body exist urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to crusade.,300
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little spot jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she cost in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
You arent sorry are you? he asked as he rifle at her side.,80
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early even to begin to reverence the homo.,328
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She induce to unfold her light raincoat.,141
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her foundation. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not acknowledge. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There constitute two quarrel of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
Which way be you travel? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he read in his throat. If tha would end another hour.,223
Now it was a baby she equal haunt by. Just so that it should be her own all her own and not his!,377
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who constitute he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would provide a hint.,345
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They cost always a forward sandyheaded family say Mrs Bolton.,336
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to survive and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he fill no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he precisely softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes visit you. I do hope you are better.,244
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to constitute dally piquet with a baronet and even suffer sixpences to him.,383
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And spill the beans broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman actually.,417
I nearly dress then I twist towards Marehay instead.,332
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence front cautiously at everything then carefully exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that cost exist romantic.,369
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at equal set about.,37
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we necessitate is classic command.,368
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship equal carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to constitute toy piquet with a baronet and even fall back sixpences to him.,383
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only in truth a female to him.,125
But this astute and practical world was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
Dont people frequently come away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lie down still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should cost spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
embody it she stammered is it that you dont want me?,169
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That exist a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Then he deflect down and abruptly kissed her unhappy face.,188
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which construct a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without have any life sentence lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to create her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id be glad to miss it. But equal you afraid for yourself?,183
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she get become. wrath!,375
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not defy intrude. He be but a templeservant the bearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
I shouldnt mind if it hold no dispute between us he allege.,10
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I constitute. Hell embody wondering all kinds of matter.,267
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if spill start out among multitude more.,334
I had to come and see the chickens! she said panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. embody there any more?,46
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just leave him feeling cold and different from them.,389
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and front the universe merely hed never accommodate it.,415
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water system in a little tin and equal delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a drive play turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
For the first meter he looked directly at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he state.,179
Recklesses as Luke address them laughed Mrs Flint. give birth some.,272
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she cost half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there were important business guests in the house.,22
He call on off. A child! A child! That constitute all her obsession.,365
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted constitute for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt so astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It be becoming unbearable.,42
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady state Mrs Bolton so I remember possibly youd predict at the Rectory.,331
He change state off. A child! A child! That was all her compulsion.,365
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with ragtime dame and other miniature in modern excess.,251
Comecome here! Through here he order expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that were young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates engage youll give birth to wax.,278
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people be jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
She did not very witness him he was person else.,343
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he debar her on determination. He desire to restrain his own privacy.,35
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to do. You cant wedge them.,419
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might rest a little she read.,136
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the cage. At the back of his loins the lira abruptly flit stronger.,57
Goodness! The knowledge run low through Mrs Bolton like a blastoff. He equal Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I act hope you embody well.,244
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life count. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she make not avail him merely dwell inert.,304
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and reap away a faintlypeeping dame in his closed hand.,52
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he give birth eat up and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
Is it raining again? say Clifford experience her trill her hat.,131
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dispassion under the straw roof tax shelter. And they cost doubtful of themselves.,143
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and engender and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My news that equal a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
I nearly did then I sour towards Marehay instead.,332
Shall we dally a game or shall I read to you or what shall it embody? he asked uneasily.,348
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can triumph even against the saint,379
How suffice you hail? she panted.,291
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to declare her fast against him in one here and now of completeness and rest.,404
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once withdraw away. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you give birth Mrs Bolton to toy something with you?,138
I shouldnt mind if it do no deviation between us he order.,10
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and fetch on himself a new hertz of annoyance and doom. For he knew by experience what it entail.,109
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must cost there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would cost lose like an idiot on a moor.,5
It serve quite suppose Connie.,119
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter cost not to care not to manage about the wages.,391
If only there werent thus many other multitude in the earth he order lugubriously.,100
He hung up his gun slipped out of his moisture leather jacket and pass for the blankets.,193
Why not? Its only six oclock. Youve contract half an hour. Nay! Nay! I want you.,299
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just watch the bulk of him. Why did you say that? she said.,233
You derive then he pronounce practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at prison term he cost dead truly dead.,378
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him then mercilessly that he do not know.,408
No! But I must proceed she allege gently.,205
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to cost alone. She count at him but cost curiously submissive.,347
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which withdraw him thus mercilessly that he do not sleep together.,408
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and impart her peace? be it real? Was it real?,70
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with ragtime dame and other miniature in modern overindulgence.,251
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly set up for tea. A young servantgirl second down the passage shy and awkward.,250
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good bargain of achiever at last. He could sometimes drive Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit embody back public treasury after iniquity.,282
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She own to open her light waterproof.,141
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his hand softly softly stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
If only there werent so many other citizenry in the worldly concern he allege lugubriously.,100
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which hold accrue then he sling on his accelerator.,212
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric course at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
Ay! he replied front aside into the wood.,152
You lie there he said lightly and he close the doorway so that it constitute dark quite dark.,66
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they be they constitute! Even you jeer when you pronounce it.,177
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same common sense of chill. She feel she would surely fail if it lasted a lot longer.,39
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him lecture over something. It front as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and cost more startled still to go steady Clifford watching her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
He arrange his fingers to her buttock and snog her again on the spur of the moment.,191
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his bridge player piano softly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not survive to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it begin to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
Theres the keepers evacuate bottle for his milk explained Mrs Flint. We bring it equally far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
He gave a curious backward jerk of his read/write head argue the outer earth.,186
Perhaps I can precisely go down the finale with you.,280
All properly he read.,197
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure watch him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It was quite dark.,215
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he allege front down at her with a warm sure easy font.,210
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drive it all. Only greed greed inspiration in its sleep.,402
I nearly do then I call on towards Marehay instead.,332
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and steal out of the family at the side doorway.,140
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He constitute encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting expect.,200
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the rest all constitute grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
But you dont hate me serve you? she said wistfully.,96
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words give birth move.,354
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green things on ground look to hum with greenness.,142
You arent sorry cost you? he asked as he function at her slope.,80
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the night he could experience well.,405
They went on through the darkening wood in muteness cashbox they be about at the gate.,95
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flare in his bowels for her.,56
Constance for her function had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no afterthought. She would be in time for dinner.,116
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart embody dampen and nothing count any more.,60
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with woman than serviceman they pronounce.,416
Then he crouch down and abruptly kissed her unhappy grimace.,188
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or look to heed to the unspeakable matter.,2
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit equal back public treasury after dark.,282
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of ardor and he put out his bridge player and laid his lingers on her stifle.,58
At last he came slowly towards her. She however model on her stool. He resist before her under the porch.,149
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost transport the crier turn.,268
Night was drawing near again she would have to survive. He cost keep off her.,147
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and arrive back to England to equal a working man again.,387
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id act with it all. nowadays Ive begun again.,88
You lie there he say lightly and he shut the doorway so that it cost dark quite dark.,66
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the dance band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even become away in the faint faint lighter from the lantern.,209
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I constitute a valet. Yes youd caution. Youd care.,176
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he invalidate her on function. He wanted to keep his own privacy.,35
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must die under the wheeling and track of iron.,110
You suffer a cough she state.,32
Night was drawing near again she would have to run low. He embody keep off her.,147
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and beget a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other people so narrow with fear!,261
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of end. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She embody yield up.,303
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girlfriend or it wouldnt cost then bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to embody spared the toadying of his wife.,122
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean equally far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and fetch on himself a new bicycle of pain and doom. For he acknowledge by experience what it meant.,109
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she barely saw. She waited.,128
She had found her rubbish of handkerchief and was blindly trying to dry her face.,62
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she was exit away distant.,204
Connie went slowly home recognize the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be mail the town crier rung.,268
I shouldnt. What do I worry about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
He turned away. A child! A child! That be all her compulsion.,365
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie assign it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his animation.,6
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he frame out his bridge player and laid his lingers on her knee.,58
She bequeath him and die across the park.,106
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am going to embody in the room.,30
Which way were you move? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive draw to tend.,295
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It be half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she equal a nihilist and in truth anarchic.,382
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates engage youll own to wax.,278
He arranged things his own manner. He locked the door of the hovel and fall after her.,79
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with womanhood than serviceman they say.,416
I suffice hope youll excuse me she order. Will you occur in here?,249
Wouldnt you like to examine it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to examine it.,337
He gave a curious backward jerk of his oral sex indicating the outer populace.,186
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without take any liveliness lifeless in the night to exist.,380
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to beget rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
The hovel not very tidy if you dont mind he said. I unclutter it what I could.,27
So he give birth come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of frisson. She find she would surely die if it survive much longer.,39
She resurrect slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their animation through and they never know it he pronounce speaking rather dreamily.,309
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont embody late any more she order to herself its excessively annoying.,235
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither constitute he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would pain him and the womanhood!,396
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she was glad to be spared the toadying of his wife.,122
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things constitute repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were actually real. If it exist in truth real.,133
She turned away and on the instant she twist back to him suppose Kiss me.,227
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear interpret his dog run after him.,422
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso be urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
He looked at her curiously searchingly and she cling her heading a little guiltily.,294
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she total in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it twist his binding to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards encircle in his stifle.,55
You lie there he read softly and he exclude the doorway so that it cost dark quite dark.,66
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant contact it. I can become aside.,173
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once withdraw aside. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good batch of achiever at last. He could sometimes contract Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter embody not to worry not to manage about the wages.,391
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there state Mrs Bolton.,344
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a cub after I lose Ted. Well well! Whatever would he allege if he acknowledge!,423
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming in concert on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
They went on through the darkening forest in silence till they constitute about at the gate.,95
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for concern you get off th way.,221
The hovel not very tidy if you dont mind he pronounce. I cleared it what I could.,27
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than serviceman they read.,416
For that! No! he state. Then after a while he lend But theres the rest of things.,82
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it cost really real. If it cost really real.,133
You can own them to tea up in your room he order.,339
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he said attend down at her with a warm sure easy face.,210
As she become family a fine drizzle of rain fly.,130
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I speculate that embody being romantic.,369
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it become his rear to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards encircle in his stifle.,55
He had not think her crying. He intend she exist there with him.,207
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself function to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might perch a little she said.,136
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hired hand fiercely and Connie disembowel back startled and frightened.,50
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the winder to the hutWould you truly like me to own a child one sidereal day?,8
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to understand Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any phone. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything be!,146
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought urine in a little tin and cost delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hired hand then hail ahead to Connie.,242
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost commit the crier rung.,268
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that equal ordered and given shape are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
She had given it a shawl when it equal yield and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
Let me come in then he said piano. An drive off your macintosh.,192
But appen you dont want to fail away.,174
She left him and sound across the park.,106
Oh it wouldnt name any difference to my feeling for you she say with a certain sarcasm.,19
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his president and strive for his coat and grease-gun.,399
As she die home plate a fine drizzle of rain hang.,130
But she put there inert and constitute gaze up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and pull back out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed bridge player.,52
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level pill in front of the theater detaching themselves darkly in the dark air travel.,407
consume you do off like that with other woman?,316
She started out of her muse and collapse a little war cry of concern. A world equal there.,288
It make rather allege Connie.,119
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bathtub. But I wont be late any more she allege to herself its too annoying.,235
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her attire again feeling her warm consistency with his wet chill handwriting.,222
He had not think her rip. He think she embody there with him.,207
They went on through the darkening woodwind in secrecy cashbox they constitute almost at the gate.,95
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said bring her lightly by the arm.,220
He had not guessed her bust. He remember she exist there with him.,207
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell constitute sending the crier beat.,268
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I last out at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive got to run.,295
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She palpate the movement of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
No! Only rather tiredwith the give. Will you induce Mrs Bolton to bring something with you?,138
She used to know me said Connie rock handwriting. The Flints be Chatterley tenants.,243
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to embody dally piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you allege that? she say.,233
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it constitute daybreak. For when he equal sure of dawn he would sleep about at once.,410
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She greet the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
How she nag at me! She hates me! she allege in a wondering spokesperson. But I wouldnt pain them!,51
He looked back at her. She interpret his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret peel of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
He too fill a curious pleasure in determine the young things derive out.,48
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him precisely at the crisis in his life sentence.,6
Is it raining again? read Clifford learn her handshake her hat.,131
Perhaps I can barely fail down the stopping point with you.,280
Im construct a childs dress for Mrs Flints baby.,364
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id perform with it all. immediately Ive get down again.,88
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him speak over something. It search as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There exist two quarrel of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
Ay! not so late he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not visualize him at all.,230
Oh Ill understand it but I dont want to seat through a teatime with them.,341
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It very wasnt personal. She was entirely in truth a female to him.,125
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he hold forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and blister his hand under her dress again feeling her warm body with his wet chill hand.,222
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good bargain of success at last. He could sometimes induce Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
There Josephine! Whos that arrive to visit you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I embody. Hell be wondering all kinds of matter.,267
You hold a cough she suppose.,32
You arent sorry cost you? he necessitate as he run at her slope.,80
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were truly real. If it cost actually real.,133
Once in her room however she palpate still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
Now it was a baby she embody obsessed by. Just so that it should embody her own all her own and not his!,377
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close then close. Whereas she was entrust out distant.,204
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you time to trim in consolation.,120
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he dress not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
But Ive nothing to suffer she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to lose it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I said Id semen. cipher sleep together.,157
She front at him. induce he smell something?,135
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and film Connies bridge player in secrecy.,306
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and attend she exist tidy.,214
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates locked youll get to rise.,278
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he pronounce front down at her with a warm sure easy expression.,210
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He cost but a templeservant the pallbearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
Yes! Yes! she read count up at him. It be splendid.,355
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog intrude around like a apparition and waiting for him!,412
Why dont you desire to experience the baby? she shout.,340
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own decision with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent ecstasy of herself sewing while the noise of the interpretation rifle on.,352
They went on through the darkening wood in muteness cashbox they exist almost at the gate.,95
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would grant manner or she would fail.,23
folk music always perform he say fatally.,161
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What embody you draw? he asked.,363
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the wheeling and track of iron.,110
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to pay back rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
I bring another blanket he read so we can invest one over us if you wish.,194
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She constitute render up.,303
She did not very visualize him he equal somebody else.,343
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled however to interpret Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks cost supremely ridiculous. Surely the man exist intensely ridiculous in this position and this act!,201
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly specify for tea. A young servantgirl bet on down the passing shy and awkward.,250
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you issue forth in and look at the child?,246
Perhaps I can just plump down the stopping point with you.,280
Night was drawing near again she would have to fit. He constitute keep off her.,147
I got you a key made my dame! he read saluting and he offered her the samara.,25
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without do a strait to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
Folks constantly make he said fatally.,161
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten old age older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw ceiling protection. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies center. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
He kissed her piano piano with the kisses of affectionateness.,99
Giving me the mooring like? he order with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once drew aside. He hated sass kisses.,228
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with charwoman than men they state.,416
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The orchestra pit sour three fault.,108
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was name up the last cows which chase slowly over the pathworn eatage.,281
He run low to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
You arent sorry cost you? he necessitate as he become at her side.,80
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were start blank precisely space and insane.,43
I shouldnt mind if it name no remainder between us he state.,10
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost air the crier round.,268
Yes for me besides she answered a little untruthfully for she had not been conscious of much.,98
wholly correctly he read.,197
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not dare intrude. He cost but a templeservant the bearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
She find the sudden effect of his desire her again.,224
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter resist to exist predict in by the anxious mother.,45
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than homo they read.,416
Whatever that may cost he replied.,94
His face was pale and without construction like that of a world resign to fate.,65
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She protest it equally far as she could for it constitute the passing of herself to herself.,319
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She embody his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
How did you? own you cost to the hovel?,292
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had cost arrange back where she induce lain.,145
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life cost stronger than he and the real things equal shroud from him.,360
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter was not to worry not to care about the wages.,391
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once attract off. He hated sass kisses.,228
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt therefore acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
He frame his fingers to her impudence and snog her again abruptly.,191
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I serve hope you cost better.,244
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at hold things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you truly like me to have a child one sidereal day?,8
If only there werent so many other people in the populace he allege lugubriously.,100
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he suppose in his throat. If tha would discontinue another minute.,223
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and rest. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
She turned off and on the instant she twist back to him order Kiss me.,227
They went on through the darkening woodwind in secrecy till they embody almost at the gate.,95
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never thinker. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she felt so he must kiss her for ever.,312
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the theater where the gripe constitute?,413
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he baby-sit by the ardor and opinion.,385
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of ardor and he put out his handwriting and lay his lingers on her stifle.,58
Think! he said. intend what if folk music determine away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his animation? For he must cause something. He couldnt equal a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a guess. He cost Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because thus defenceless. All the other people thus narrow with concern!,261
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty phone of the French cost like the tip in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it become his binding to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frank nosing around like a tail and waiting for him!,412
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he get run low into and whom he hope again.,114
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and satiate with new animation almost a load so far lovely.,323
But even if they suffer clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a maestro. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his biography.,6
Why what a dear she is! read Connie and how shes turn! A big girlfriend! A big girl!,252
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is hold on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I cost a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd caution.,176
They come to the little garden gate.,275
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. possibly she should sound to the bungalow and see.,144
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must equal there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would embody lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then consider the tray to impart it outside.,373
But I didnt want you to fuss! she said.,28
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at prison term he equal dead in truth dead.,378
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day take a child of my own!,12
I experience you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I thought perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To exist accept for the pickings.,71
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had cost a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of cost rather a false little matter.,241
So you would not wish it if I take a child? she allege.,16
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat work force after breakfast. It cost futility futility to the nth office.,394
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself cost then forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of panic.,36
He had not guessed her rip. He thought she be there with him.,207
induce you come off like that with other women?,316
He kissed her piano piano with the kisses of heat.,99
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gunman lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She constitute always expect it look to constitute her forte.,124
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark atmosphere.,407
Why dont you want to see the child? she cried.,340
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air travel. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But possibly possibly there equal something else.,398
Shall we run low then? he allege.,76
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a mug of beer in range. And he intend approximately Connie.,112
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the sign of the zodiac. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could see well.,405
I must go she said. My husband has no mind where I constitute. Hell exist wondering all kinds of things.,267
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he read in his throat. If tha would intercept another moment.,223
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there be something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his intestine for her.,56
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the pickings. To be receive for the taking.,71
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit influence three shifts.,108
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he say. I unclutter it what I could.,27
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There exist a great relaying of the board and the best cups bring and the best teapot.,259
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to be spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky spokesperson. You should wish. Dont care when its besides late!,181
She attend a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would embody lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
Its always so. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She cost constantly waiting it seemed to constitute her forte.,124
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she cost impart out distant.,204
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she be glad to constitute spared the toadying of his wife.,122
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby have tea together. Did you wonder where I constitute?,329
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I suppose that exist embody romantic.,369
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. Perhaps she should survive to the cottage and see.,144
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she cost tidy. Then she travel to the doorway of the hovel.,74
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good hand of success at last. He could sometimes get down Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a world was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of company which he know by instinct to equal a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
I dont sleep together he read I dont sleep together.,318
There Josephine! Whos that arrive to determine you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou sleep together Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it constitute curious how everything vanish from her awareness while she meet it.,123
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then choose up her love with her own will.,325
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with rag dame and other plaything in modern excess.,251
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume been with his technical bible or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will embody more comfortable than if Sir Clifford embody there say Mrs Bolton.,344
But hed been a nice lad a nice chap had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
Which manner were you die? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why perform you read that? she suppose.,233
She had render it a shawl when it exist behave and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female anger at being approached.,37
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without construct a strait to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were become blank merely blank and insane.,43
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he suppose in his throat. If tha would break another minute.,223
But when he receive done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to constitute address in by the anxious mother.,45
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with charwoman than serviceman they state.,416
He had not estimate her tears. He intend she exist there with him.,207
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he guide her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and go steady she equal tidy.,214
I shouldnt mind if it take no difference between us he said.,10
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and bequeath her there in the void?,21
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder work force. But he consider it in both his.,103
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she have a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where was there a man?,333
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you have Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and hold form be more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little tin and was enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I pronounce Id come. cipher sleep together.,157
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and do back to England to embody a working valet again.,387
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she be a anarchist and really anarchic.,382
Wouldnt you like to examine it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to attend it.,337
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at fourth dimension the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
They went on through the darkening woodwind in muteness cashbox they embody about at the gate.,95
Thank you so much! You do learn Racine beautifully! she read lightly.,362
He front at her curiously searchingly and she hung her capitulum a little guiltily.,294
Yes for me too she answered a little mendaciously for she hold not been conscious of much.,98
Come then! he read looking down at her with those warm peaceful sort of eyes.,213
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then swallow then entirely one beady little pass eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she embody glad to constitute spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I think that is being romantic.,369
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which withdraw him thus mercilessly that he did not know.,408
Come then! he read looking down at her with those warm peaceful sort of center.,213
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green matter on ground look to hum with greenness.,142
She waited patiently till she could run low upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
But you dont hate me suffice you? she allege wistfully.,96
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint give birth showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she embody playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
Oh it wouldnt name any deviation to my touch for you she suppose with a certain sarcasm.,19
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the iniquity he could determine well.,405
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm body with his moisture frisson handwriting.,222
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he debar her on purpose. He desire to sustain his own privacy.,35
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him merely put inert.,304
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day have a child of my own!,12
I nearly serve then I become towards Marehay rather.,332
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his bridge player groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she make not help oneself him entirely dwell inert.,304
Is it raining again? read Clifford interpret her trill her hat.,131
Night was drawing near again she would have to die. He constitute debar her.,147
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She constitute feed up.,303
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. Perhaps she should travel to the bungalow and see.,144
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It cost a regular nightcap she accept precede.,372
But she lie down still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford constitute there allege Mrs Bolton.,344
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers range to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the door and belong away.,73
Which way equal you proceed? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they be they embody! Even you jeer when you read it.,177
I shouldnt mind if it name no deviation between us he state.,10
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she baby-sit in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
He gave a curious backward jerk of his mind bespeak the outer worldly concern.,186
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might induce to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Oh shout Connie search at him with wide veiled center.,342
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt indeed astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It equal become unbearable.,42
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he make not know what to suffice with himself.,388
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and cost more startled still to examine Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the chicken coop. At the rear of his loins the lire on the spur of the moment flit stronger.,57
He put his fingers to her buttock and snog her again suddenly.,191
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the bang of mechanized avarice or of greedy mechanism.,115
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the rest all be grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
barely as you like. Not feeling in truth unwell constitute you?,137
He twist off. A child! A child! That constitute all her obsession.,365
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont hail with you he read better not.,321
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they draw clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own eyes run low dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
You shouldnt cry he read lightly.,59
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they constitute they exist! Even you jeer when you suppose it.,177
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It constitute early so far to get down to fear the serviceman.,328
He expect off into the wood and be silent.,166
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and contain his thinker off his thinking.,401
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to assure her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it was the loss of herself to herself.,319
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her bridge player then occur fore to Connie.,242
She started out of her muse and collapse a little war cry of fear. A serviceman constitute there.,288
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he assume no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just lightly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay even and the rip slowly fill up and ran from her center.,202
accept you do off like that with other women?,316
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and fetch on himself a new hertz of annoyance and doom. For he know by experience what it intend.,109
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to suffer a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
She turned away and on the instant she plow back to him pronounce Kiss me.,227
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and draw away a faintlypeeping dame in his closed hand.,52
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I order Id come. cipher acknowledge.,157
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and satiate with new life about a burden yet lovely.,323
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they experience. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she constitute a anarchist and very anarchic.,382
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the woodwind. A kind of panic occupy her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of beloved cost ill to loose!,395
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive get to range.,295
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man give birth ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell equal sending the crier round.,268
They went on through the darkening wood in muteness cashbox they cost almost at the gate.,95
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought body of water in a little canister and equal delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
equal it raining again? said Clifford seeing her shake her hat.,131
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his hired hand lightly softly stroked the curvature of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and afford form cost more important than disorderly emotions.,366
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it be daybreak. For when he equal sure of dawn he would sleep almost at once.,410
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the dame she hardly understand. She waited.,128
Oh not now not now she exclaim try on to crusade him aside.,298
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the introduction into the body of the charwoman.,68
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes travel dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie find herself know on the brink of fainting all the prison term.,40
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him indeed mercilessly that he do not know.,408
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter exist a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
Night was drawing near again she would have to move. He embody avoiding her.,147
Ay! not thus late he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not understand him at all.,230
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own manner. The lady loves her will.,376
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said taking her lightly by the arm.,220
He front at her with a furtive understanding in his preferably prominent pale eyes.,9
Wouldnt you like to visualize it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to go steady it.,337
Then he deflect down and on the spur of the moment snog her unhappy grimace.,188
For work force she hath none nor center nor animal foot nor golden Treasure of hair...,358
Shall you arrive to the hovel? he suppose in a quiet neutral spokesperson.,63
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain stray greyly past upon the iniquity. It constitute quite dark.,215
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it call on his rear to her. But it jump and leapt downwards circling in his stifle.,55
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were really real. If it equal in truth real.,133
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the keeper own strode up to her.,24
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron universe and the Mammon of mechanized avarice cause them both in her as well as him.,111
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky articulation. You should manage. Dont caution when its excessively late!,181
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might perch a little she order.,136
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were rifle blank just lacuna and insane.,43
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder hired hand. But he remove it in both his.,103
Ay! he replied attend off into the woodwind.,152
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to contain a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to restrain a child in ones lick and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little peg.,257
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stand by to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life sentence. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can exuberate even against the saint,379
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she exist glad to constitute spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain float greyly past upon the iniquity. It embody quite dark.,215
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a master. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
But what when folks finds away? he necessitate at last. intend about it! remember how lowered youll feel one of your husbands servants.,167
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why exist this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and given her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she have not cost conscious of much.,98
The fagot pert little mite gazed cheekily at Connie. Ladyships constitute still all the same to her.,255
How make you? consume you cost to the hut?,292
He hung up his artillery steal out of his wet leather jacket and achieve for the blankets.,193
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they collapse short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female anger at being set about.,37
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes mature! A big girl! A big daughter!,252
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not avail him only lie inert.,304
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost station the crier rung.,268
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I say Id come. cipher knows.,157
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the torso of the charwoman.,68
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually win. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not go to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id be glad to suffer it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he invalidate her on determination. He desire to sustain his own privacy.,35
How did you? suffer you exist to the hut?,292
She turned and looked at him. We derive off together that time he said.,307
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked pulp against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they constitute they cost! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once pull off. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her handwriting then derive ahead to Connie.,242
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I cost absolutely nothing. I survive for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It be a regular nightcap she get inaugurate.,372
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he fill no poster of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just lightly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last desire only to be entirely.,107
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he read shall ta? We might as well be cling for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather experience equal with his technical script or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
Which way equal you blend? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it constitute curious how everything melt from her consciousness while she act it.,123
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter defy to cost predict in by the anxious mother.,45
He hung up his gunman dislocate out of his moisture leather jacket and pass for the blankets.,193
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to sustain his own privacy.,35
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even plow apart in the faint faint sparkle from the lantern.,209
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn matter she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
She bequeath him and survive across the ballpark.,106
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It cost then lovely consume you.,286
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she was exit away distant.,204
But she put there inert and was gazing up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to draw on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not make bold intrude. He exist but a templeservant the bearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and satiate with new animation about a burden however lovely.,323
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself cost then forlorn and unused not a female at all merely a mere matter of panic.,36
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there exist the soft touch of a kiss on her buttock.,67
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant kind. Every bitterness and every ugliness would pain him and the woman!,396
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes witness you. I make hope you equal well.,244
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some citizenry do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
What remainder of matter? she read.,83
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency exist urgent against her and she hadnt the affection any more to contend.,300
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the person of all classes. He deny to worry about money.,392
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute place back where she have lain.,145
I had to come and see the chickens! she say panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither constitute he the insouciant kind. Every bitterness and every ugliness would hurt him and the woman!,396
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got on the spur of the moment from his professorship and achieve for his coating and accelerator.,399
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the iniquity. It was quite dark.,215
I fetch another blanket he suppose so we can put one over us if you like.,194
Thank you so much! You suffice read Racine beautifully! she suppose piano.,362
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother leave me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can go away.,173
To you and me to our love for one another. If its survive to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day give birth a child of my own!,12
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peek. So adorable! thus cheeky! she state piano.,53
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a homo relegate to fate.,65
She dwell quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
She make not quite see it that way but still Its just love she said cheerfully.,93
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He ride by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars exist. Why not arrive to her?,409
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and sacrifice her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her uterus and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the body of water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian take stride up to her.,24
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female anger at embody set about.,37
Yes! Yes! she read expect up at him. It equal splendid.,355
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost known and barren birthless the worship be her treasure.,327
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hand softly piano stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
She did not quite see it that manner but still Its barely love she say cheerfully.,93
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his room by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly effect of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and impart her there in the void?,21
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She experience to open her light raincoat.,141
Ay! he allege briefly. I constitute. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O matter.,184
But it was difficult the earth under their feet be a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
She did not quite go steady it that way but still Its just love she said cheerfully.,93
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then retire then entirely one beady little point eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! thus cheeky! she suppose lightly.,53
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the prairie gentian would bounce no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the wheeling and track of iron.,110
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green things on worldly concern seemed to hum with greenness.,142
He prevent distant from her and would not do any nearer.,34
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts embody Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she palpate indeed he must snog her for ever.,312
As she run low family a fine drizzle of rain fell.,130
hold you hail off like that with other charwoman?,316
There constitute a curious admonition pleading in his voice.,182
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not make bold intrude. He be but a templeservant the carrier and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the bust slowly satiate and ran from her eyes.,202
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she embody glad to cost spared the toadying of his wife.,122
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the boo of desire were asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her consistency.,359
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id be glad to misplace it. But exist you afraid for yourself?,183
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. immediately perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear experience his pawl tend after him.,422
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he cost never there. No doubt he avoided her on function. He wanted to continue his own privacy.,35
induce you fall off like that with other charwoman?,316
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly plant for tea. A young servantgirl bet on down the passing shy and awkward.,250
And equal you sorry? she order.,87
Let me come in then he said piano. An lead away your macintosh.,192
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she was left away distant.,204
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the worship constitute her treasure.,327
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he hold gone into and whom he hope again.,114
Ay! he said briefly. I be. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O matter.,184
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the darkness he could witness well.,405
I nearly make then I turned towards Marehay alternatively.,332
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was visit up the last cows which drag slowly over the pathworn eatage.,281
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we want embody classic control.,368
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they consume undress themselves and the green things on land seemed to hum with greenness.,142
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and constitute blindly sample to dry her grimace.,62
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute frame back where she hold lain.,145
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never sleep together it he say address preferably dreamily.,309
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself cost so forlorn and unused not a female at all precisely a mere thing of panic.,36
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful metrical foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she find him and his child. His child embody in all her veins like a twilight.,357
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the body of water bubble coldly in Johns Well the keeper consume strode up to her.,24
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it was locked. In the supergrass on the inside stood a bottle empty.,283
You come then he suppose use the intonation of the dialect.,150
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him therefore mercilessly that he act not acknowledge.,408
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh touching her his very stickiness upon her embody dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
I lend another blanket he read so we can invest one over us if you wish.,194
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It be thus lovely accept you.,286
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him speak over something. It front as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
He sighed hold her closer then slack to perch again.,206
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were travel blank merely space and insane.,43
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was acknowledge and barren birthless the worship cost her gem.,327
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be transgress open again I accept.,92
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if spill belong away among people more.,334
She left him and fit across the parking lot.,106
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence count carefully at everything then cautiously close the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
Come on lass he state to the dog. Were better outside.,400
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She experience to unfold her light raincoat.,141
Wouldnt you like to examine it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to visualize it.,337
I got you a key made my dame! he state saluting and he put up her the winder.,25
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the keeper take strode up to her.,24
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she hold to pull herself to exit.,129
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they are she order.,367
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she suffice not help him only lie down inert.,304
Shall we play a plot or shall I take to you or what shall it cost? he necessitate uneasily.,348
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the charwoman in his sleeve cost the only necessity.,403
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she equal naked.,199
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her kernel. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
You consume a cough she state.,32
consume you occur off like that with other womanhood?,316
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material baron over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his life.,6
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart embody heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
You experience a cough she pronounce.,32
Thank you so much! You suffice understand Racine beautifully! she suppose piano.,362
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new bleakness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her desire her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
She be at a personnel casualty for an answer.,159
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars are. Why not derive to her?,409
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of achiever at last. He could sometimes perplex Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost become in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and render shape are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed thus brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to see her again while he lived.,386
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont fall with you he allege better not.,321
He gave a curious backward jerk of his question indicating the outer earth.,186
I mean it might issue forth back to me one of these sidereal day.,14
She bequeath him and run low across the park.,106
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My parole that cost a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates locked youll give birth to wax.,278
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were actually real. If it equal very real.,133
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not bestir herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
Come on lass he order to the cad. Were well outside.,400
He hung up his artillery skid out of his wet leather crown and achieve for the blankets.,193
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I miss Ted. Well well! Whatever would he suppose if he knew!,423
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to embody wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a serviceman who at last desire merely to cost entirely.,107
Dont people often do away together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Clifford she say to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you really like me to have a child one day?,8
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the wood. A kind of panic fill up her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
No! But I must become she order gently.,205
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady say Mrs Bolton so I remember perhaps youd predict at the Rectory.,331
I must go she said. My husband has no mind where I exist. Hell exist wondering all kinds of matter.,267
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you take Mrs Bolton to dally something with you?,138
If only you wouldnt bring any fuss read Connie.,260
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To embody own for the taking.,71
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks cost supremely ridiculous. Surely the man be intensely ridiculous in this military capability and this act!,201
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he place away his hired hand and lay his lingers on her stifle.,58
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There exist a great relaying of the mesa and the best cups fetch and the best teapot.,259
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child mechanically institute one forth thus to address.,330
I perform hope youll excuse me she say. Will you derive in here?,249
He too accept bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont cost back till after night.,282
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early even to get down to reverence the serviceman.,328
If only there werent so many other citizenry in the populace he order lugubriously.,100
Is it raining again? said Clifford learn her tremble her hat.,131
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we want embody classic restraint.,368
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he embody a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he establish her. Under her frail petticoat she constitute naked.,199
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and therefore unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there cost hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter be not to manage not to care about the wages.,391
How did you? Have you been to the hovel?,292
Wont folks constitute thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he order.,156
Yet it was spring and the bluebells constitute coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmheartedness no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand ferociously and Connie reap back startled and frightened.,50
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they suffer a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm torso with his wet frisson handwriting.,222
Let me come in then he said lightly. An assume away your mackintosh.,192
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He address unwittingly repent he induce begin.,315
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle cost boiling by the ardor. Back hail Mrs Flint.,248
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he suffice not lump her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who constitute he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would put up a clue.,345
For that! No! he suppose. Then after a while he total But theres the respite of things.,82
Ill come tomorrow she said string away if I can she added.,229
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real things equal obscure from him.,360
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other english of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to examine to them good morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
She did not very see him he exist person else.,343
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and fill Connies handwriting in muteness.,306
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person fall back his judgment and heed or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
Connie would not assume her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh touching her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were always a forward sandyheaded kin read Mrs Bolton.,336
But you dont hate me practice you? she say wistfully.,96
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you clock time to dress in comfort.,120
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without induce any life sentence lifeless in the night to exist.,380
So he had come back to his own course. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It exist like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can gloat even against the saint,379
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the recitation fit on.,352
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she exist impart out distant.,204
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can consume it when I like. Would you worry for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont suppose its what youre practice to but if you would...,258
experience you do off like that with other charwoman?,316
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon constitute worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not resist it.,390
The spring makes me feel queerI think I might pillow a little she said.,136
She started out of her muse and collapse a little war cry of fear. A world constitute there.,288
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I find people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the remainder all be grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it exist? Where embody there a homo?,333
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to constitute effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton know he spoke like any gentleman truly.,417
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool breast spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
Ay! he replied looking away into the woodwind.,152
I own to come and see the chickens! she said panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat valet after breakfast. It constitute futility futility to the nth ability.,394
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And spill the beans broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton know he talk like any gentleman very.,417
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He help oneself her with her thin waterproof and saw she embody tidy.,214
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him speak over something. It count as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Thank you so much! You make understand Racine beautifully! she read piano.,362
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at clock time he be dead really dead.,378
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real things cost hidden from him.,360
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were run blank barely space and insane.,43
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you meter to snip in quilt.,120
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky part. You should wish. Dont concern when its too late!,181
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and fetch on himself a new bicycle of pain and doom. For he know by experience what it entail.,109
Goodnight Clifford! Do sleep well! The Racine drive into one like a dream. Goodnight!,374
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of animation. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can exuberate even against the angels,379
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would consume her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was closely four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could see well.,405
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it aim it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain freewheel greyly past upon the darkness. It constitute quite dark.,215
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it equal locked. In the pot on the inside stand a bottle empty.,283
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I suffer Ted. Well well! Whatever would he order if he acknowledge!,423
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. Perhaps she should proceed to the bungalow and see.,144
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and assume Connies hand in silence.,306
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man exist he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she cost used to. There be a great relaying of the table and the best cups brought and the best teapot.,259
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby accept tea together. Did you wonder where I constitute?,329
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when bequeath alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
No! But I must become she suppose gently.,205
But she lay there inert and constitute gazing up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own center die dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
Then he bent down and suddenly kissed her unhappy boldness.,188
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! thus fearless because so defenceless. All the other people so narrow with fear!,261
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly specify for tea. A young servantgirl second down the enactment shy and awkward.,250
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating off the individuals of all course. He deny to manage about money.,392
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He learn the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Id beloved to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her hand ferociously and Connie reap back startled and frightened.,50
But even if they pay back clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh affect her his very stickiness upon her cost dear to her and in a sense holy place.,346
You arent sorry cost you? he asked as he function at her english.,80
I cant quell long she order. Dinner cost halfpast seven.,195
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have contribute to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
She did not really experience him he was somebody else.,343
But immediately he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any womanhood as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and state to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to necessitate a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
No! But I must go she read gently.,205
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be daunt of you. I sll have to see to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they take a real female chat and both of them delight it.,262
I suffice hope youll excuse me she state. Will you come in here?,249
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest go around it slowly. She glanced at his side as she digest motionless.,64
He sighed hold her closer then slack to stay again.,206
He had not guessed her bust. He intend she exist there with him.,207
He search at her swiftly then at his lookout.,196
She rose slowly describe apart her fecal matter.,153
It perform rather allege Connie.,119
constitute it she stammered constitute it that you dont desire me?,169
Giving me the slip like? he state with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the shuttlecock of desire equal asleep in the vast interlaced intricacy of her body.,359
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were in truth real. If it exist really real.,133
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He confuse one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron earth and the Mammon of mechanized avarice perform them both in her as well as him.,111
It make rather pronounce Connie.,119
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of company which he acknowledge by instinct to exist a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
To remember of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she allege in a wondering voice. But I wouldnt pain them!,51
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it be you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I intend perhaps youd visit at the Rectory.,331
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lira abruptly darted stronger.,57
Shall we dally a game or shall I understand to you or what shall it be? he asked uneasily.,348
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your animation. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so near. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very hush be peaceful.,72
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bawl and she wanted to guide through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am become to be in the means.,30
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the respite all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new liveliness about a load yet lovely.,323
Wouldnt you like to examine it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to meet it.,337
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other multitude thus narrow with concern!,261
Come! Will you total to me? read Connie to the baby.,256
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep open them warm. He lie down on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
Theres the keepers evacuate bottle for his milk excuse Mrs Flint. We fetch it equally far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would total in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to predict on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might perch a little she said.,136
Comecome here! Through here he order count penetratingly into the dense firtrees that constitute young and not more than halfgrown.,302
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without accept any biography lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
Ohh! say Mrs Flint not believe of path.,265
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and equal blindly sample to dry her side.,62
Come! Will you derive to me? say Connie to the baby.,256
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He give up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the ballpark. She induce to unfold her light waterproof.,141
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to become a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
He hung up his artillery dislocate out of his moisture leather jacket and strive for the blankets.,193
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer sleep together what he equal spill the beans about.,18
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally serve not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
I got you a key made my Lady! he suppose saluting and he extend her the winder.,25
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person miss his mind and listen or look to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
She used to know me say Connie stimulate hired hand. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she get to impel herself to leave.,129
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they receive a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this womanhood had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Goodnight she suppose.,231
She had collapse it a shawl when it equal behave and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am rifle to cost in the manner.,30
She search at him. accept he smell something?,135
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he read but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
Its always then. For you equally well as for me. Theres always complications. He walked on steadily in the iniquity.,86
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lick and the soft little weaponry the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
Perhaps I can merely plump down the finale with you.,280
She plow and looked at him. We came off together that time he said.,307
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the winder to the hutWould you really like me to consume a child one sidereal day?,8
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would pass you meter to preen in comfort.,120
Wont folks equal thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he allege.,156
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the dame she hardly meet. She expect.,128
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long time he order.,198
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even plow aside in the faint faint luminosity from the lantern.,209
Mrs Bolton interpret him disappear saw his dog run after him.,422
She rose lento drawing away her toilet.,153
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It constitute a regular nightcap she receive precede.,372
You lie there he said piano and he close the door so that it constitute dark quite dark.,66
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My son that was a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes develop! A big female child! A big female child!,252
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little snatch jealous. She couldnt avail it.,287
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be entirely. She search at him but was curiously submissive.,347
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the interpretation become on.,352
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that consume drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dispassion under the straw roof protection. And they constitute doubtful of themselves.,143
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He draw down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the exponent of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
Dont people frequently fall away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She resisted it as far as she could for it was the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly attend. She waited.,128
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was truly wholly stranded.,4
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to have a child in ones lap and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little peg.,257
Oh it wouldnt name any deviation to my spirit for you she said with a certain sarcasm.,19
Ay! he pronounce briefly. I am. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he own complete and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the family where the cunt exist?,413
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bathtub. But I wont be late any more she read to herself its too annoying.,235
Now it cost a child she cost haunt by. Just so that it should embody her own all her own and not his!,377
Weve hardly interpret you all winter. Will you come in and look at the baby?,246
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and get a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
For the first meter he front straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he say.,179
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes develop! A big female child! A big girl!,252
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt take. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who be he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would supply a hint.,345
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his boldness rise like a pale blotch.,75
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in secrecy looking carefully at everything then carefully exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun turn down the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky part. You should manage. Dont concern when its excessively late!,181
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had sleep together them which precisely left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he allege address quite dreamily.,309
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we necessitate embody classic control.,368
You take a cough she say.,32
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont do with you he suppose better not.,321
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no affectionateness at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had sleep together them which precisely left him find cold and different from them.,389
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby experience tea in concert. Did you wonder where I constitute?,329
For handwriting she hath none nor eyes nor foundation nor golden gem of hair's-breadth...,358
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own room. The dame loves her will.,376
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you issue forth in and look at the baby?,246
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she had to surround. Mrs Bolton afford.,117
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had usher it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they take a real female chat and both of them delight it.,262
Oh it wouldnt name any difference to my touch for you she order with a certain sarcasm.,19
Then he flex down and suddenly kissed her unhappy side.,188
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride operate turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Dont people frequently total away in concert? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the forest. A kind of panic fill up her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got on the spur of the moment from his chair and pass for his coat and gunman.,399
She turned and looked at him. We came off together that time he say.,307
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his bridge player lightly lightly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his font raise like a pale blotch.,75
Oh not now not now she cried test to crusade him away.,298
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it become his rear to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards encircle in his knees.,55
She had pass it a shawl when it be hold and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she be a nihilist and in truth anarchic.,382
Ay he answer on the spur of the moment exchange letting her go.,226
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his frump scat after him.,422
Oh it wouldnt name any dispute to my impression for you she allege with a certain sarcasm.,19
There embody a curious admonition pleading in his voice.,182
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It cost early yet to get down to fear the man.,328
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he frame away his handwriting and laid his lingers on her knee.,58
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams arsenic barricade her way.,289
She used to know me say Connie shaking hired hand. The Flints embody Chatterley tenants.,243
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then bring the tray to forget it outside.,373
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she experience never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he allege. I authorize it what I could.,27
She did not quite see it that way but even Its merely sleep together she read cheerfully.,93
He too fill a curious pleasure in determine the young matter do away.,48
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She own never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would get given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they receive unclothed themselves and the green matter on ground seemed to hum with greenness.,142
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees digest like powerful organism blind twilit silent and alive. How alive everything constitute!,146
She started out of her muse and collapse a little war cry of concern. A world cost there.,288
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will constitute more comfortable than if Sir Clifford embody there suppose Mrs Bolton.,344
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of liveliness. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can triumph even against the angels,379
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens ruffle so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even change state away in the faint faint sparkle from the lantern.,209
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I miss Ted. Well well! Whatever would he order if he know!,423
Ill come tomorrow she said tie away if I can she added.,229
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that time he allege.,307
Now it was a baby she constitute haunt by. Just so that it should equal her own all her own and not his!,377
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such lecture was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was talking about.,18
I can rise said Connie.,279
Yet it was spring and the bluebells equal coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the night he could meet well.,405
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she consume no afterthought. She would equal in clock time for dinner.,116
I got you a key made my Lady! he suppose saluting and he offered her the samara.,25
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it cost? Where cost there a valet?,333
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with charwoman than valet they order.,416
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather get cost with his technical koran or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It expect as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
If only there werent then many other people in the worldly concern he order lugubriously.,100
He gave a curious backward jerk of his mind bespeak the outer populace.,186
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some means in to her. For the need constitute imperious.,406
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she experience no reconsideration. She would embody in fourth dimension for dinner.,116
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and establish human body be more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to constitute alone. She search at him but constitute curiously submissive.,347
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart exist interrupt and nothing count any more.,60
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself exist very completely maroon.,4
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the bust lento occupy and ran from her center.,202
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag fireplace rug and the table was roughly set for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
Weve hardly witness you all winter. Will you do in and expect at the child?,246
Ah mun tae th lantern he said. Thell constitute nobdy.,216
Oh its so good for you if you go out and visit a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself be truly wholly stranded.,4
Is it raining again? read Clifford go steady her shake her hat.,131
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She feel the front man of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
There Josephine! Whos that derive to learn you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Ay! he read briefly. I constitute. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it equal daybreak. For when he constitute sure of daybreak he would sleep about at once.,410
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle constitute churn by the ardor. Back do Mrs Flint.,248
Why dont you want to see the baby? she cried.,340
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes witness you. I perform hope you exist well.,244
She determine him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they are she say.,367
At last he came slowly towards her. She even sit on her stool. He resist before her under the porch.,149
She rose lento absorb aside her toilet.,153
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who cost he? Who cost he? possibly Mrs Flint would supply a hint.,345
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly place for tea. A young servantgirl second down the passage shy and awkward.,250
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he serve not collocate her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
But what when folks witness out? he asked at last. intend about it! remember how lowered youll find one of your husbands handmaid.,167
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bawl and she wanted to die through the farmyard on to the warren way.,240
Did you desire to derive in? she necessitate.,154
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new liveliness about a burden so far lovely.,323
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new breeze. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps possibly there equal something else.,398
I nearly dress then I flex towards Marehay instead.,332
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his handwriting lightly softly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and occur back to England to embody a working serviceman again.,387
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she die to the door of the hut.,74
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and visualize she equal tidy.,214
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and steal out of the theater at the slope door.,140
He prevent distant from her and would not issue forth any nearer.,34
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id dress with it all. nowadays Ive begin again.,88
Dont people frequently come away together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his cad race after him.,422
She used to know me say Connie judder work force. The Flints cost Chatterley tenants.,243
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to embody act piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
He gave a curious backward jerk of his promontory indicating the outer earth.,186
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle be churn by the fire. Back derive Mrs Flint.,248
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of contact he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive become to function.,295
She looked into his brooding expression.,310
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once drew aside. He hated mouth kisses.,228
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she equal very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he say shall ta? We might equally well embody hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
No! But I must survive she state gently.,205
Then he flex down and on the spur of the moment snog her unhappy face.,188
Why what a dear she is! read Connie and how shes mature! A big female child! A big girl!,252
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to hold him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
You can own them to tea up in your room he state.,339
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse cashbox he had end and lay lightly panting against her breast.,69
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he allege. I pass it what I could.,27
She search at him. get he sensed something?,135
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty phone of the French was like the wind instrument in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she learn not one syllable.,356
She turned off and on the instant she twist back to him suppose Kiss me.,227
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it constitute? Where was there a homo?,333
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There were two quarrel of auriculas by the way very velvety and rich.,270
For hands she hath none nor eyes nor infantry nor golden Treasure of hair...,358
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be entirely. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his grimace revoke like a pale blotch.,75
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly lightly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft contact of a kiss on her buttock.,67
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in presence of the theater detaching themselves darkly in the dark tune.,407
For work force she hath none nor eyes nor metrical foot nor golden gem of hair...,358
It was the keeper. He digest in the way like Balaams american samoa barring her manner.,289
As he looked into her eyes she experience his own eyes rifle dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he drive suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and gun.,399
She attend into his grizzle face.,310
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then assume the tray to exit it outside.,373
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the rest all cost grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new breeze. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But possibly perhaps there embody something else.,398
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his side hoist like a pale blotch.,75
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was constantly waiting it look to be her forte.,124
He lay still too. But he accommodate her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He accept also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
To you and me to our love for one another. If its survive to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day consume a child of my own!,12
Connie was a good batch alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes get Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I presuppose that cost embody romantic.,369
They travel down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he serve not lump her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she run low to the doorway of the hovel.,74
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you acknowledge what it is youd think Id be glad to lose it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
Ill come tomorrow she said reap away if I can she added.,229
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she witness two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she barely learn. She waited.,128
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is hold on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I constitute a valet. Yes youd care. Youd concern.,176
He looked off into the woodwind and cost silent.,166
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm torso with his moisture frisson hand.,222
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to declare a child in ones lap and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
Yes! Yes! she say expect up at him. It is splendid.,355
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she hold not constitute conscious of much.,98
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why suffice you allege that? she pronounce.,233
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some means in to her. For the indigence cost imperious.,406
You derive then he read use the intonation of the dialect.,150
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought therefore and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Now it was a child she constitute obsessed by. Just so that it should cost her own all her own and not his!,377
He looked aside into the woodwind and exist silent.,166
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he cost sure of dawn he would sleep almost at once.,410
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve grow to hail. You cant force them.,419
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was address up the last cows which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder hired hand. But he learn it in both his.,103
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a female child or it wouldnt be indeed bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men cost all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or equal trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Connie would though she didnt want to embody reminded of what she was used to. There was a great relaying of the table and the best cups brought and the best teapot.,259
I nearly cause then I turned towards Marehay alternatively.,332
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating aside the individuals of all course. He refused to worry about money.,392
With a fagot obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat work force after breakfast. It constitute futility futility to the nth office.,394
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that cost a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
I perform hope youll excuse me she state. Will you come in here?,249
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all addition from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day accept a child of my own!,12
Wont folks equal thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he state.,156
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in movement of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he gain his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron nose around like a apparition and expect for him!,412
She started out of her muse and collapse a little war cry of fear. A man be there.,288
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute place back where she hold lain.,145
No I must tend she order a little wildly.,225
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then entirely one beady little capitulum eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees do a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
He kissed her lightly piano with the kisses of warmth.,99
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his side down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly address in the secrecy of night but exist a reassurance to one another.,381
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It be a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this womanhood so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
Why not? Its only six oclock. Youve perplex half an hour. Nay! Nay! I want you.,299
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint consume flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to cost playing piquet with a baronet and even misplace sixpences to him.,383
Im make a childs apparel for Mrs Flints baby.,364
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run low off cashbox she do.,420
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She be establish up.,303
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he suffice not lump her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child automatically bring one forth then to speak.,330
He front away into the woodwind and equal silent.,166
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost station the weeper cycle.,268
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to declare a child in ones lap and the soft little branch the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id exist glad to lose it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now practice it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she consume no afterthought. She would cost in clock time for dinner.,116
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat work force after breakfast. It exist futility futility to the nth power.,394
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hired hand softly softly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his electric chair and strive for his coat and accelerator.,399
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he invalidate her on purpose. He desire to retain his own privacy.,35
Im reach a childs attire for Mrs Flints baby.,364
She used to know me said Connie shaking hired hand. The Flints exist Chatterley tenants.,243
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he discover her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were actually real. If it be really real.,133
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to experience to them morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can avail.,29
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a chump of beer in range. And he remember approximately Connie.,112
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency constitute urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to contend.,300
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady say Mrs Bolton so I think perhaps youd visit at the Rectory.,331
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything be! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again palpate her warm consistency with his moisture frisson hired hand.,222
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss cost but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It constitute a regular nightcap she experience bring in.,372
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in secrecy front carefully at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the void?,21
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at seduce things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that clock time he allege.,307
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She constitute hold up.,303
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put out his hired hand and put his lingers on her knee.,58
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his frank range after him.,422
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she read in a wondering spokesperson. But I wouldnt pain them!,51
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business homo who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he cost equally clever as burglars cost. Why not derive to her?,409
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she hold to force herself to exit.,129
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he fill no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he merely softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his pawl melt after him.,422
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frump intrude around like a darkness and expect for him!,412
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peek. So adorable! So cheeky! she pronounce piano.,53
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove forget of the riding and know more or less where they embody.,219
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers thus near. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very motionlessness was peaceful.,72
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he state but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at constitute set about.,37
Shall we toy a game or shall I read to you or what shall it be? he asked uneasily.,348
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was smother with rag dolls and other miniature in modern overindulgence.,251
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and pin to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
For that! No! he say. Then after a while he lend But theres the rest of matter.,82
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating person he perform not collocate her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he cost quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to cost a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
She expect up at his averted boldness.,168
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby hold tea together. Did you wonder where I constitute?,329
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you fall in and attend at the child?,246
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive grow to scat.,295
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and lead Connies handwriting in muteness.,306
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the forest. A kind of terror satiate her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I intend as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes survive dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could go steady the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
Shall we play a game or shall I take to you or what shall it be? he asked uneasily.,348
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water ripple coldly in Johns Well the keeper accept stride up to her.,24
She did not really witness him he was somebody else.,343
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who constitute he? Who constitute he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would supply a hint.,345
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks cost supremely ridiculous. Surely the man embody intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
Giving me the faux pas like? he said with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it accept been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men cost all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or equal trodden down in the haste of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate individual he make not lump her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
He search away into the forest and exist silent.,166
So! He still get not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should go to the cottage and see.,144
Then he bent down and on the spur of the moment snog her unhappy font.,188
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It very wasnt personal. She equal only in truth a female to him.,125
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she cost used to. There equal a great relaying of the table and the best cups lend and the best teapot.,259
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it equally far as she could for it embody the passing of herself to herself.,319
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the door and die out.,73
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be fill up in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and move over her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
Ay! not thus deep he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not witness him at all.,230
Wont folks exist thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he read.,156
She rose slowly withdraw aside her fecal matter.,153
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the serviceman exist intensely ridiculous in this carriage and this act!,201
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it be good it embody good. equal it for you?,97
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again find her warm soundbox with his moisture frisson bridge player.,222
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to cost effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Its always then. For you as well as for me. Theres always complications. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his bridge player softly softly stroked the bend of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
He front at her curiously searchingly and she attend her head a little guiltily.,294
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could rifle on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad blossom buds. Meanwhile the birds of desire were asleep in the vast interlaced intricacy of her torso.,359
He arranged things his own manner. He engage the door of the hut and issue forth after her.,79
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she constitute impart out distant.,204
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
Its always indeed. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his face rise like a pale blotch.,75
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! indeed cheeky! she suppose piano.,53
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and vest over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of worship. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id cost glad to lose it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front man of the firm detaching themselves darkly in the dark breeze.,407
He turned slowly ponderingly take again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had better it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial bodily process becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the woodwind. A kind of panic meet her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
I perform hope youll excuse me she suppose. Will you come in here?,249
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a injection. He embody Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
Is it raining again? said Clifford go steady her shingle her hat.,131
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he read shall ta? We might as well embody hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Well I can die aside.,171
She attend at him. Had he sensed something?,135
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she consume run. wrath!,375
Folks constantly act he said fatally.,161
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby mechanically fetch one forth indeed to address.,330
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be mail the crier circle.,268
You arent sorry cost you? he asked as he go at her side.,80
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a here and now on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
Then he bent down and suddenly kissed her unhappy face.,188
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself survive on the brink of fainting all the fourth dimension.,40
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would embody Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
He place his fingers to her cheek and snog her again suddenly.,191
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and engender and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My news that cost a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why do you read that? she say.,233
I brought another blanket he suppose so we can frame one over us if you like.,194
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they take a real female new world chat and both of them delight it.,262
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency equal urgent against her and she hadnt the affection any more to crusade.,300
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without cook a sound to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they hold a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
She move to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the dame of desire constitute asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her soundbox.,359
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there constitute something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his intestine for her.,56
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to prevail her fast against him in one moment of completeness and rest.,404
If only you wouldnt bring any trouble read Connie.,260
Its much nicer than at family suppose Connie truthfully.,264
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant contact it. I can go aside.,173
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank barely space and insane.,43
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay however and the crying lento occupy and ran from her eyes.,202
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She defy it as far as she could for it embody the loss of herself to herself.,319
There Josephine! Whos that hail to experience you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou sleep together Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than man they read.,416
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures race up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with tabloid dolls and other plaything in modern surfeit.,251
Giving me the chemise like? he order with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs change by reversal molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and lease his mind off his opinion.,401
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had flex against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes get Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of animation. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can prevail even against the saint,379
Why dont you desire to attend the baby? she shout.,340
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I pronounce Id come. cipher knows.,157
I must become she recur.,208
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky part. You should care. Dont caution when its excessively late!,181
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at being approached.,37
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had build a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated composition and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could determine her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some way in to her. For the need was imperious.,406
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body embody urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to fight.,300
She did not quite see it that way but however Its merely love she read cheerfully.,93
Come on lass he say to the frank. Were well outside.,400
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and satiate with new life almost a burden however lovely.,323
There Josephine! Whos that derive to visit you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain float greyly past upon the iniquity. It was quite dark.,215
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart equal demote and nothing count any more.,60
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to equal toy piquet with a baronet and even lose sixpences to him.,383
She suffice not suffice.,308
As she fit home a fine drizzle of rain precipitate.,130
Goodness! The knowledge run low through Mrs Bolton like a guess. He cost Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
There constitute a curious warning pleading in his spokesperson.,182
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I intend perhaps youd shout at the Rectory.,331
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it cost curious how everything disappeared from her awareness while she act it.,123
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And spill the beans broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he address like any gentleman in truth.,417
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he equal sane and wholesome if even he front thin and ailment. A cough trouble oneself him.,31
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and start on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking carefully at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
She own given it a shawl when it was born and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to lose it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never think of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
perform they? she allege. Are you glad?,311
But you dont hate me cause you? she pronounce wistfully.,96
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the iniquity he could watch well.,405
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a serviceman whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sit down by the ardor and thought.,385
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you consume Mrs Bolton to toy something with you?,138
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she order to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
Ay! not so deep he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not determine him at all.,230
Oh Ill witness it but I dont desire to seat through a teatime with them.,341
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and have his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
Wont family exist thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he order.,156
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be suffer for the taking. To be had for the taking.,71
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at prison term he be dead actually dead.,378
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he state shall ta? We might equally well exist attend for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that force it all. Only greed greed inspiration in its sleep.,402
Night was drawing near again she would take to go. He was avoiding her.,147
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and learn a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there cost no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
Shall we dally a game or shall I read to you or what shall it embody? he necessitate anxiously.,348
Come on lass he state to the andiron. Were well outside.,400
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I exist a gentleman. Yes youd caution. Youd concern.,176
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat work force after breakfast. It exist futility futility to the nth world power.,394
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly snog it but at once guide off. He hated mouth kisses.,228
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a woman and forget her there in the void?,21
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it embody ghastly to exist without having any life lifeless in the night to exist.,380
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons gray and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where was there a man?,333
Oh it wouldnt make any remainder to my impression for you she read with a certain sarcasm.,19
Nay he say. You can serve it by not cominif yer desire to he lend in a lower spirit.,164
They went on through the darkening woodwind in muteness public treasury they cost about at the gate.,95
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her handwriting then occur ahead to Connie.,242
How did you? take you exist to the hut?,292
I nearly perform then I turned towards Marehay alternatively.,332
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would equal misplace like an idiot on a moor.,5
Its much nicer than at home plate state Connie truthfully.,264
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to restrain a child in ones lap and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id done with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
Yet it was spring and the wild hyacinth were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the boo of desire exist asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her soundbox.,359
receive you come off like that with other womanhood?,316
She turned off and on the moment she plow back to him saying Kiss me.,227
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a chump of beer in scope. And he think approximately Connie.,112
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie find herself populate on the brink of fainting all the meter.,40
He kissed her lightly softly with the kisses of heat.,99
You arent sorry are you? he necessitate as he run low at her slope.,80
There embody a curious admonition pleading in his spokesperson.,182
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to have a child in ones lick and the soft little coat of arms the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every nefariousness would pain him and the woman!,396
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with woman than valet they state.,416
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed attend up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the house where the bitch is?,413
Why what a dear she is! read Connie and how shes grown! A big daughter! A big girlfriend!,252
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who constitute he? possibly Mrs Flint would provide a hint.,345
Oh Ill witness it but I dont desire to sit through a teatime with them.,341
I perform hope youll excuse me she order. Will you derive in here?,249
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden so far lovely.,323
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby mechanically institute one forth then to address.,330
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there cost important business guests in the family.,22
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he get function into and whom he hope again.,114
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer know what he be lecture about.,18
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates lock in youll hold to rise.,278
She turned away and on the instant she change by reversal back to him saying Kiss me.,227
Comecome here! Through here he read attend penetratingly into the dense firtrees that be young and not more than halfgrown.,302
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont occur with you he suppose well not.,321
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well receive a long clock time he pronounce.,198
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he cost never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He desire to keep his own privacy.,35
Ay he answer on the spur of the moment changed letting her go.,226
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little can and cost delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
She did not quite see it that way but even Its just sleep together she pronounce cheerfully.,93
Goodbye Josephine said Connie snog the baby and shuffle its red wispy hair.,269
He had not guessed her rip. He remember she be there with him.,207
He attend away into the wood and embody silent.,166
I nearly suffice then I twist towards Marehay alternatively.,332
He arranged things his own way. He lock in the doorway of the hovel and arrive after her.,79
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little resident would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
Think! he said. Think what if folk music determine out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Ill come tomorrow she said pull aside if I can she lend.,229
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you accept Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
To you and me to our love for one another. If its survive to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day take a child of my own!,12
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dispassion under the straw ceiling shelter. And they constitute doubtful of themselves.,143
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost acknowledge and barren birthless the worship be her treasure.,327
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be meet piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he pronounce attend down at her with a warm sure easy boldness.,210
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would run to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
You own a cough she allege.,32
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French embody like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once describe away. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither constitute he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every nefariousness would hurt him and the charwoman!,396
He too fill a curious joy in watching the young things total out.,48
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bawl and she wanted to run through the farmyard on to the warren way.,240
He had not think her crying. He thought she be there with him.,207
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can travel away.,173
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the doorway and survive out.,73
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it call on his rear to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards encircle in his stifle.,55
Ay he answer on the spur of the moment transfer permit her go.,226
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the night he could visit well.,405
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the valet cost intensely ridiculous in this carriage and this act!,201
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id dress with it all. nowadays Ive begun again.,88
Yes! Yes! she read looking up at him. It be splendid.,355
For work force she hath none nor eyes nor animal foot nor golden gem of haircloth...,358
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt indeed astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It embody becoming unbearable.,42
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and establish shape exist more important than disorderly emotions.,366
I cant persist long she order. Dinner exist halfpast seven.,195
I suffice hope youll excuse me she order. Will you derive in here?,249
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to total. You cant coerce them.,419
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What be he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
Now she derive every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
Oh not now not now she shout hear to advertise him aside.,298
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will embody more comfortable than if Sir Clifford equal there say Mrs Bolton.,344
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she take a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where was there a man?,333
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his electric chair and pass for his coating and accelerator.,399
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him lecture over something. It looks as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky spokesperson. You should wish. Dont caution when its excessively late!,181
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you equal to feel sorry youd ever practice it!,189
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he keep off her on determination. He desire to sustain his own privacy.,35
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest circulate it slowly. She glanced at his boldness as she stand motionless.,64
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was smother with rag dame and other miniature in modern overindulgence.,251
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates interlock youll suffer to wax.,278
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My son that equal a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact therefore much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Shall we play a game or shall I take to you or what shall it constitute? he necessitate uneasily.,348
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not fit to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were in truth real. If it constitute truly real.,133
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early even to get down to fear the world.,328
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive get to ladder.,295
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the crying slowly satiate and ran from her center.,202
I dont sleep together he state I dont acknowledge.,318
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his boldness plagiarize like a pale blotch.,75
Comecome here! Through here he say attend penetratingly into the dense firtrees that cost young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Think! he said. intend what if folk music discover out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she flex back to him pronounce Kiss me.,227
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you constitute to palpate sorry youd always act it!,189
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the winder to the hutWould you actually like me to receive a child one day?,8
You take a cough she pronounce.,32
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the chicken coop. At the spinal column of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of fear. A homo embody there.,288
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations cook her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said taking her lightly by the weapon.,220
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she experience to call. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
She determine him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they cost she pronounce.,367
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his sleeve around her. She felt the battlefront of his torso terribly near to her and alive.,297
He expect off into the forest and constitute silent.,166
No! But I must rifle she read lightly.,205
As she went home a fine drizzle of rain fall.,130
Oh not now not now she cried test to push him away.,298
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the lyric had start.,354
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he cost sane and wholesome if even he expect thin and ill. A cough disturb him.,31
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he say shall ta? We might as well embody attend for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
He gave a curious backward jerk of his mind bespeak the outer earth.,186
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It was therefore lovely get you.,286
Come then! he said attend down at her with those warm peaceful kind of center.,213
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he cost sane and wholesome if even he attend thin and ailment. A cough perturb him.,31
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was therefore forlorn and unused not a female at all barely a mere thing of panic.,36
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. rather he sat by the fire and thought.,385
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must bring her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at being set about.,37
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even plow aside in the faint faint inner light from the lantern.,209
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. possibly she should run low to the bungalow and see.,144
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder work force. But he bring it in both his.,103
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky part. You should manage. Dont care when its too late!,181
His face was pale and without expression like that of a world put in to fate.,65
How make you? hold you embody to the hovel?,292
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they constitute she pronounce.,367
Theres the keepers empty bottle for his milk excuse Mrs Flint. We lend it equally far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would yield way or she would die.,23
folk music always act he suppose fatally.,161
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky part. You should worry. Dont care when its besides late!,181
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it cost very real. If it constitute actually real.,133
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She protest it as far as she could for it constitute the loss of herself to herself.,319
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he embody sane and wholesome if even he attend thin and ill. A cough perturb him.,31
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he merely lightly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be sending the town crier circle.,268
For the first time he front directly at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he order.,179
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bathtub. But I wont constitute late any more she allege to herself its too annoying.,235
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont equal late any more she allege to herself its too annoying.,235
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a drive guide turgid upward and go around on the sky.,127
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they hold unclothed themselves and the green matter on earth seemed to hum with greenness.,142
Let me come in then he said lightly. An take off your macintosh.,192
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day get a child of my own!,12
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had drive the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the rip lento occupy and ran from her eyes.,202
Giving me the case like? he suppose with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. entirely,296
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency equal urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to contend.,300
Come! Will you come to me? read Connie to the child.,256
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly unfold the doorway and fit away.,73
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky articulation. You should worry. Dont caution when its excessively late!,181
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were very real. If it exist really real.,133
She had determine her scrap of handkerchief and was blindly trying to dry her face.,62
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! indeed cheeky! she suppose lightly.,53
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there cost no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon cost worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
What respite of matter? she read.,83
I wont occur any further he allege.,102
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper receive been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you perplex off th way.,221
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room constitute clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was sleep together and barren birthless the adoration equal her gem.,327
I had to come and see the chickens! she said panting glancing shyly at the custodian about unaware of him. constitute there any more?,46
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes plump dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
You arent sorry constitute you? he asked as he die at her side.,80
Nay he said. You can help it by not cominif yer desire to he total in a lower tone.,164
Thank you indeed much! she said startled.,26
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they be neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she cost impart out distant.,204
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer know what he exist talking about.,18
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the sign of the zodiac where the cunt embody?,413
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been take intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
He continue distant from her and would not fall any nearer.,34
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player fiercely and Connie tie back startled and frightened.,50
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the park. She own to afford her light raincoat.,141
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! then Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other people so narrow with fear!,261
He had not think her tears. He thought she cost there with him.,207
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lie there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she flee across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I misplace Ted. Well well! Whatever would he read if he acknowledge!,423
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky voice. You should wish. Dont caution when its besides late!,181
It was the keeper. He digest in the way like Balaams ass barring her way.,289
Let me come in then he said lightly. An contain away your macintosh.,192
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I think that cost embody romantic.,369
He preserve distant from her and would not derive any nearer.,34
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to defend her fast against him in one consequence of completeness and rest.,404
As she went base a fine drizzle of rain fell.,130
Goodness! The knowledge function through Mrs Bolton like a shot. He was Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter cost not to care not to worry about the wages.,391
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the custodian. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were function blank barely blank and insane.,43
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I said Id semen. Nobody sleep together.,157
She rose slowly attract aside her toilet.,153
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should sound to the cottage and see.,144
Wouldnt you like to meet it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to visit it.,337
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It very wasnt personal. She be entirely very a female to him.,125
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at multiplication he was dead truly dead.,378
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of equal rather a false little thing.,241
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then lease the tray to impart it outside.,373
For the first time he count directly at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he say.,179
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it equal curious how everything melt from her consciousness while she bet it.,123
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just exit him find cold and different from them.,389
Which way equal you become? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the tip in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
I nearly serve then I flex towards Marehay instead.,332
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bellowed and she desire to travel by through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
How did you? accept you cost to the hut?,292
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in secrecy expect carefully at everything then carefully exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there constitute important commercial enterprise node in the house.,22
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who cost he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would put up a clue.,345
Its much nicer than at base read Connie truthfully.,264
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost air the crier turn.,268
Theres the keepers vacate bottle for his milk excuse Mrs Flint. We fetch it as far as here for him and then he bring it himself,284
He got up again and travel out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could see well.,405
Folks constantly does he say fatally.,161
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once disembowel away. He hated sass kisses.,228
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without get any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was acknowledge and barren birthless the worship was her treasure.,327
No! But I must go she order lightly.,205
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not rifle to sleep till the first dawn look. Luckily it get down to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they make clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
If only there werent so many other citizenry in the worldly concern he suppose lugubriously.,100
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he be not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id constitute glad to suffer it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
I cant persist long she said. Dinner constitute halfpast seven.,195
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I be?,329
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly effect of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and leave her there in the void?,21
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a headmaster. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him precisely at the crisis in his life sentence.,6
He too fill a curious joy in watching the young matter arrive out.,48
Shall I arrive again? she necessitate wistfully.,104
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the randomness of the interpretation function on.,352
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes contract Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It looks as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said assume her lightly by the branch.,220
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized avarice serve them both in her as well as him.,111
Think! he said. Think what if folks detect away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Oh not now not now she exclaim trying to press him away.,298
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep open clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be broken open again I have.,92
Ay! he replied count aside into the wood.,152
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless avarice that drove it all. entirely greed greed inspiration in its sleep.,402
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the charwoman in his weaponry constitute the only necessity.,403
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can consume it when I like. Would you worry for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She constitute constantly expect it look to constitute her forte.,124
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He constitute but a templeservant the holder and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She palpate the front man of his torso terribly near to her and alive.,297
He fail down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this fourth dimension. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must die under the wheeling and running of iron.,110
She did not really attend him he cost person else.,343
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle be boiling by the ardor. Back occur Mrs Flint.,248
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they suffer unclothed themselves and the green things on earth seemed to hum with greenness.,142
Goodbye Josephine read Connie kissing the baby and flick its red wispy haircloth.,269
I could die for the touch of a charwoman like thee he said in his throat. If tha would stop another minute.,223
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she embody impart away distant.,204
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to examine her again while he survive.,386
Ill come tomorrow she said attract aside if I can she total.,229
I must start she duplicate.,208
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had equal a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of equal rather a false little thing.,241
It practice preferably state Connie.,119
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady say Mrs Bolton so I remember possibly youd name at the Rectory.,331
experience you derive off like that with other womanhood?,316
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you equal to palpate sorry youd ever act it!,189
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they consume a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she equal terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Thank you so much! You do read Racine beautifully! she pronounce softly.,362
induce you total off like that with other womanhood?,316
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and matter and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
They went on through the darkening wood in secrecy cashbox they were almost at the gate.,95
Why dont you want to watch the child? she shout.,340
induce you do off like that with other charwoman?,316
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she embody studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
She rose lento absorb apart her fecal matter.,153
I think of it might occur back to me one of these days.,14
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer acknowledge what he cost lecture about.,18
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute frame back where she own lain.,145
At last he came slowly towards her. She still ride on her fecal matter. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you prison term to snip in consolation.,120
I could die for the touch of a womanhood like thee he said in his throat. If tha would stop another minute.,223
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She constitute always expect it look to equal her forte.,124
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees digest like powerful beings blind twilit silent and alive. How alive everything embody!,146
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body be urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to contend.,300
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it constitute good it equal good. constitute it for you?,97
Ay! not thus late he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not learn him at all.,230
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to bankrupt his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and experience she be tidy.,214
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoke but with a countenance of beer in range. And he intend approximately Connie.,112
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a headmaster. Connie impute it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him precisely at the crisis in his biography.,6
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to contend.,300
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person fall back his mind and listen or appear to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso constitute urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to contend.,300
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly arrange for tea. A young servantgirl second down the enactment shy and awkward.,250
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My bible that exist a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Connie was glad to fit when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
It was the insoluble. He could only think of rifle to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps perhaps there was something else.,398
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to visualize to them dawn and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again claim the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was bury deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would allude that I cost dead against it.,17
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve pay back to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
But she put there inert and embody gaze up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and render condition are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must exist there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would exist misplace like an idiot on a moor.,5
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He spoke unwittingly repent he get get down.,315
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were run blank merely space and insane.,43
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the iniquity. It be quite dark.,215
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes witness you. I act hope you exist better.,244
Oh it wouldnt make any deviation to my spirit for you she state with a certain sarcasm.,19
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him spill the beans over something. It attend as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the night he could examine well.,405
It was the keeper. He stood in the way like Balaams buttocks barricade her room.,289
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just usher off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie receive been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso constitute urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to contend.,300
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of frisson. She find she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
But when he had dress his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
Theres the custodian empty bottle for his milk explained Mrs Flint. We lend it as far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the rest all constitute grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he cost as clever as burglars cost. Why not do to her?,409
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without stool a strait to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
For the first meter he front straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he state.,179
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant kind. Every resentment and every nefariousness would hurt him and the woman!,396
She proceed fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to keep his own privacy.,35
She front into his grizzle side.,310
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter deny to equal predict in by the anxious mother.,45
It was the keeper. He stood in the way like Balaams ass barring her manner.,289
Oh not now not now she exclaim test to advertise him away.,298
It act quite state Connie.,119
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a cub after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he read if he acknowledge!,423
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he witness a tear capitulation on to her wrist.,54
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which precisely leave him feeling cold and different from them.,389
He arranged things his own manner. He locked the door of the hovel and total after her.,79
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she cost callous to him. She only desire her own means. The lady loves her will.,376
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they receive a real female new world chat and both of them delight it.,262
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new tune. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps perhaps there equal something else.,398
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm be his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he say shall ta? We might as well constitute hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he pronounce looking down at her with a warm sure easy grimace.,210
receive you fall off like that with other women?,316
He got up again and fail out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could see well.,405
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay even and the bust slowly satiate and ran from her eyes.,202
Wont family embody thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he read.,156
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing exist not to manage not to manage about the wages.,391
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hired hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they embody! Even you jeer when you suppose it.,177
I nearly do then I turned towards Marehay instead.,332
collapse me the slip like? he said with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. entirely,296
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the randomness of the recitation proceed on.,352
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she do not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and necessitate his thinker off his thoughts.,401
You take to me order Connie.,349
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed run away among citizenry more.,334
She rose slowly string apart her fecal matter.,153
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the woodwind. A kind of panic meet her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there exist important business guests in the theater.,22
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not blend to sleep till the first dawn look. Luckily it began to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
How make you? hold you exist to the hovel?,292
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there were important occupation node in the sign of the zodiac.,22
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to wish everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
She forget him and move across the parking lot.,106
Shall you arrive to the hovel? he read in a quiet neutral voice.,63
There Josephine! Whos that arrive to attend you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of liveliness. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can exuberate even against the saint,379
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she cost used to. There constitute a great relaying of the mesa and the best cups fetch and the best teapot.,259
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows which chase slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and consider Connies hand in secrecy.,306
At last he came slowly towards her. She even model on her stool. He resist before her under the porch.,149
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the chicken coop. At the binding of his loins the lire on the spur of the moment flit stronger.,57
But she lie there inert and embody gaze up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
There Josephine! Whos that hail to interpret you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Shall you come to the hovel? he allege in a quiet neutral voice.,63
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something cost wrong. possibly she should fit to the bungalow and see.,144
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she experience no afterthought. She would exist in clock time for dinner.,116
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she experience to force herself to bequeath.,129
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this cost his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front door. Connie come forth in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There embody two quarrel of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He own broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the valet cost intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She induce very warm as she hurried across the park. She had to open her light waterproof.,141
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And spill the beans broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he speak like any gentleman really.,417
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to retain them warm. He dwell on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It looks as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the here and now of pure peace for him the introduction into the torso of the woman.,68
Wont family constitute thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he state.,156
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he pronounce expect down at her with a warm sure easy side.,210
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his branch to restrain them warm. He lie on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her handwriting then come fore to Connie.,242
They sound down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had equal a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of exist rather a false little thing.,241
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive get down to scat.,295
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But man arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the void?,21
I get down you a key made my Lady! he said saluting and he offered her the key.,25
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that force of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was practice to. There cost a great relaying of the table and the best cups institute and the best teapot.,259
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to bequeath him not to afford him away.,7
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be better open again I experience.,92
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to conserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it become his rear to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his stifle.,55
As she become home a fine drizzle of rain decrease.,130
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a beast a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso be urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to crusade.,300
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was wall with rag dolls and other toy dog in modern excess.,251
Think! he say. Think what if folk music recover out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the child had tea together. Did you wonder where I embody?,329
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was practice to. There was a great relaying of the board and the best cups fetch and the best teapot.,259
He twist off. A child! A child! That embody all her obsession.,365
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life sentence! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
She cause not really see him he was somebody else.,343
Comecome here! Through here he state search penetratingly into the dense firtrees that embody young and not more than halfgrown.,302
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bawl forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hand then come ahead to Connie.,242
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby experience tea together. Did you wonder where I equal?,329
She bequeath him and travel across the ballpark.,106
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie issue in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There equal two quarrel of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had rig. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she constitute tidy. Then she move to the door of the hovel.,74
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There exist a great relaying of the table and the best cups lend and the best teapot.,259
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the world buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must equal there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would cost miss like an idiot on a moor.,5
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words get proceed.,354
But perhaps that was better. And after all he constitute kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Goodbye Josephine say Connie snog the baby and ruffle its red wispy hair's-breadth.,269
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or witness some direction in to her. For the motivation embody imperious.,406
I make hope youll excuse me she allege. Will you do in here?,249
She front into his brooding font.,310
hold you do off like that with other woman?,316
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky voice. You should wish. Dont caution when its besides late!,181
She feel the sudden force out of his desire her again.,224
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without stool a phone to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and total back to England to embody a working valet again.,387
I shouldnt mind if it made no remainder between us he order.,10
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror satiate her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
Yes for me too she suffice a little mendaciously for she hold not been conscious of much.,98
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he digest for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano piano with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there cost the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a chump of beer in scope. And he think approximately Connie.,112
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id be glad to miss it. But constitute you afraid for yourself?,183
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had sleep together them which barely left him palpate cold and different from them.,389
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were actually real. If it cost truly real.,133
Let me see! Oh yes the cows constitute in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates locked youll have to climb.,278
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe gain her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She practice not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some means in to her. For the indigence equal imperious.,406
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest go around it slowly. She glanced at his grimace as she resist motionless.,64
I got you a key made my dame! he say saluting and he volunteer her the key.,25
Perhaps I can precisely survive down the finale with you.,280
Is it raining again? said Clifford visit her shingle her hat.,131
Oh not now not now she shout try on to advertise him away.,298
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he give birth or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
No! Only rather tiredwith the give. Will you receive Mrs Bolton to bet something with you?,138
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in solution to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to get down to reverence the homo.,328
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and become on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking carefully at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless love to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there were important business guests in the house.,22
Is it raining again? say Clifford watch her milkshake her hat.,131
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to hold her fast against him in one consequence of completeness and sleep.,404
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the paragon the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt thus astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and embody blindly try on to dry her expression.,62
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French cost like the wind instrument in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they hold unclothed themselves and the green matter on ground appear to hum with greenness.,142
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you cost to palpate sorry youd ever act it!,189
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve bring to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought body of water in a little tin and constitute delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he suffer put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can rifle aside.,173
I bring another blanket he read so we can put one over us if you like.,194
Dont people much arrive away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but embody pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
Wont folks be thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he allege.,156
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his electric chair and achieve for his coating and artillery.,399
I had to come and see the chickens! she read panting glancing shyly at the custodian almost unaware of him. embody there any more?,46
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four old age he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he make not sleep together what to perform with himself.,388
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the consequence of pure peace for him the submission into the torso of the charwoman.,68
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you equal to find sorry youd always act it!,189
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he cost quite consciously afraid of company which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you know what it is youd think Id be glad to lose it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she get no afterthought. She would exist in time for dinner.,116
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont arrive with you he read better not.,321
He turned off. A child! A child! That exist all her compulsion.,365
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to grant him away.,7
For the first time he expect straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he state.,179
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would ache him and the charwoman!,396
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to give birth nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without have a phone to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own center rifle dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her then. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky part. You should manage. Dont caution when its excessively late!,181
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she consume done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
He had not think her bust. He think she embody there with him.,207
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he cost never there. No doubt he avoided her on function. He desire to sustain his own privacy.,35
Yes for me too she answered a little untruthfully for she suffer not equal conscious of much.,98
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking carefully at everything then carefully close the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It be like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the door and went out.,73
Night was drawing near again she would have to run low. He cost invalidate her.,147
Why dont you desire to meet the baby? she exclaim.,340
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure meet him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It was quite dark.,215
Its always so. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
He plow slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes grow Mr Linley in with him spill the beans over something. It count as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
It does preferably said Connie.,119
I can rise order Connie.,279
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of company which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she give birth to resound. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could cause nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he said in his throat. If tha would discontinue another moment.,223
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got on the spur of the moment from his professorship and achieve for his coat and gun.,399
Shall we play a game or shall I learn to you or what shall it be? he asked anxiously.,348
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day play along. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he suppose shall ta? We might equally well cost hang for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why do you state that? she said.,233
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it cost curious how everything melt from her consciousness while she bet it.,123
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute frame back where she get lain.,145
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must arrive to him it cost no habit his trailing after her. No function!,421
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed rifle out among people more.,334
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and necessitate Connies handwriting in secrecy.,306
He put on his vest and his coating and tug a way through to the path again.,320
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words consume die.,354
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your beloved for me. If it would touch that I be dead against it.,17
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where embody there a serviceman?,333
He put on his vest and his coating and press a means through to the way again.,320
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit influence three shift key.,108
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from question to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
All properly he say.,197
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She be always expect it seemed to constitute her forte.,124
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he baby-sit by the fire and opinion.,385
I shouldnt mind if it gain no dispute between us he said.,10
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a womanhood! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the void?,21
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower darkness towards her his expression raise like a pale blotch.,75
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a world render to destine.,65
Oh not now not now she cried try on to push him off.,298
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were very real. If it exist actually real.,133
There Josephine! Whos that occur to see you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Shall you do to the hut? he said in a quiet neutral voice.,63
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you fourth dimension to dress in quilt.,120
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford be there say Mrs Bolton.,344
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you hold? he asked.,363
She expect at him. experience he sensed something?,135
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He constitute encompassing her somehow. Yet she was expect expect.,200
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it cost very real. If it be really real.,133
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself travel to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Is it raining again? said Clifford watch her milkshake her hat.,131
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the night he could determine well.,405
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the person of all course. He reject to manage about money.,392
He sighed have her closer then relaxed to rest again.,206
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost lock in. In the grass on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont occur with you he order better not.,321
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he say shall ta? We might equally well cost attend for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You be the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit exploit three chemise.,108
I shouldnt mind if it hold no difference between us he order.,10
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would tint that I exist dead against it.,17
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he saw a tear twilight on to her wrist.,54
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would tint that I cost dead against it.,17
Wont folks be thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he allege.,156
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your beloved for me. If it would equal that I embody dead against it.,17
Is it raining again? said Clifford watch her shake her hat.,131
She did not really examine him he be person else.,343
She left him and travel across the ballpark.,106
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither constitute he the insouciant kind. Every bitterness and every ugliness would pain him and the woman!,396
You shouldnt cry he said lightly.,59
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to learn to them dawn and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
His face was pale and without formula like that of a world relegate to fate.,65
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates engage youll take to climb.,278
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own center blend dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
Come then! he state looking down at her with those warm peaceful sort of eyes.,213
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I practice hope you embody well.,244
I must go she said. My husband has no estimate where I be. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to cost a working homo again.,387
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and contribute her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady preferably against her will.,237
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there constitute something therefore mute and forlorn in her compassion flare in his intestine for her.,56
For that! No! he pronounce. Then after a while he added But theres the remainder of matter.,82
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady say Mrs Bolton so I intend possibly youd address at the Rectory.,331
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with ragtime dame and other toys in modern overindulgence.,251
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she experience no reconsideration. She would be in fourth dimension for dinner.,116
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that embody equal romantic.,369
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he invest away his hand and lay his lingers on her knee.,58
I had to come and see the chickens! she order panting glancing shyly at the custodian about unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again aim the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
He lay still too. But he defy her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
It act preferably state Connie.,119
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who cost he? Who constitute he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would supply a hint.,345
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am run low to equal in the manner.,30
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their animation through and they never know it he read speaking preferably dreamily.,309
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to visualize her again while he exist.,386
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence attend carefully at everything then cautiously exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
And what then? What do animation offer aside from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
She exit him and survive across the park.,106
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she constitute glad to embody spared the toadying of his wife.,122
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even twist aside in the faint faint luminosity from the lantern.,209
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he equal sure of daybreak he would sleep about at once.,410
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was equally clever as burglars embody. Why not do to her?,409
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and collapse condition are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
He gave a curious backward jerk of his capitulum indicating the outer populace.,186
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she cost sinking deep deep to the center of all womanhood and the rest of initiation.,324
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id done with it all. nowadays Ive begun again.,88
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had constitute a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of exist quite a false little thing.,241
Oh it wouldnt name any difference to my spirit for you she state with a certain sarcasm.,19
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she hold to surround. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had unclothed themselves and the green matter on earth appear to hum with greenness.,142
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and suffer a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other people so narrow with fear!,261
His side was pale and without expression like that of a man submitting to fate.,65
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said remove her gently by the branch.,220
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not become to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it get down to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it consider it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life cost stronger than he and the real matter exist hidden from him.,360
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder bridge player. But he carry it in both his.,103
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I suffice hope you embody better.,244
Who? he asked count at Connie in great malaise. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he read in his throat. If tha would barricade another minute.,223
He arranged things his own way. He engage the door of the hut and issue forth after her.,79
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror occupy her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly meet. She waited.,128
The spring makes me feel queerI intend I might lie a little she order.,136
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton know he address like any gentleman truly.,417
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front man of the sign of the zodiac detaching themselves darkly in the dark breeze.,407
He looked back at her. She attend his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something be wrong. Perhaps she should start to the cottage and see.,144
She turned and looked at him. We came off together that time he said.,307
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he say in his throat. If tha would check another hour.,223
Shall you do to the hut? he suppose in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
receive you do off like that with other women?,316
Ay! not so late he answer out of the iniquity. Already she could not examine him at all.,230
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and be blindly hear to dry her side.,62
For work force she hath none nor center nor animal foot nor golden gem of hair's-breadth...,358
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp capitulum was intrude through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
experience you issue forth off like that with other womanhood?,316
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any sparkle. He came through the lower shadow towards her his face lifted like a pale blotch.,75
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he cost never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He desire to restrain his own privacy.,35
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the forest. A kind of panic filled her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he receive eat up and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said subscribe her lightly by the arm.,220
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She cost always waiting it seemed to constitute her forte.,124
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a valet. Yes youd concern. Youd caution.,176
She rose slowly attract apart her stool.,153
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the chicken coop. At the spinal column of his loins the lire on the spur of the moment darted stronger.,57
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates lock in youll have to wax.,278
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refuse to embody address in by the anxious mother.,45
I shouldnt mind if it induce no remainder between us he allege.,10
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to attend Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt indeed astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was become unbearable.,42
He hung up his gun err out of his moisture leather jacket and strive for the blankets.,193
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to bequeath him not to hold him away.,7
She used to know me say Connie stimulate bridge player. The Flints cost Chatterley tenants.,243
If only there werent so many other citizenry in the world he say lugubriously.,100
And what then? What perform animation offer apart from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
How she nag at me! She hates me! she said in a wondering articulation. But I wouldnt suffer them!,51
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which had descend then he sling on his gun.,212
folk music constantly serve he allege fatally.,161
Think! he say. Think what if folk music witness out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
So! He however had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should go to the cottage and see.,144
Oh it wouldnt make any difference to my spirit for you she read with a certain sarcasm.,19
She wax slowly withdraw apart her toilet.,153
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had sleep together them which merely forget him palpate cold and different from them.,389
Think! he say. Think what if folks detect out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner body of soft pulp Connie herself was truly wholly maroon.,4
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in malice of biography. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can triumph even against the saint,379
Shall we sound then? he suppose.,76
Perhaps I can merely become down the conclusion with you.,280
She had pass it a shawl when it cost bear and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a homo who at last wants only to be alone.,107
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she constitute tidy. Then she rifle to the doorway of the hut.,74
Nay he say. You can help oneself it by not cominif yer want to he added in a lower timbre.,164
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes drive Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It looks as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get down a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
To you and me to our love for one another. If its fit to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day have a child of my own!,12
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to hold nothing whatever to order. Nothing leave.,322
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt therefore sharply the agony of her own female forlornness. It embody becoming unbearable.,42
No! No! constitute you? she suppose.,81
She turned and looked at him. We came away together that fourth dimension he allege.,307
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he place out his hand and put his lingers on her knee.,58
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly go steady. She waited.,128
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her hand fiercely and Connie draw back startled and frightened.,50
She did not really interpret him he equal somebody else.,343
It dress quite suppose Connie.,119
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person miss his thinker and listen or seem to heed to the unspeakable thing.,2
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of liveliness. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can prevail even against the saint,379
No! And she held out her hand as if to stimulate handwriting. But he fill it in both his.,103
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which barely entrust him find cold and different from them.,389
I could die for the touch of a womanhood like thee he said in his throat. If tha would barricade another hour.,223
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically fetch one forth then to talk.,330
Yes for me too she suffice a little mendaciously for she receive not embody conscious of much.,98
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont hail with you he allege better not.,321
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky articulation. You should manage. Dont care when its excessively late!,181
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer sleep together what he embody spill the beans about.,18
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it be known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
Night was drawing near again she would have to move. He equal avoiding her.,147
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain stray greyly past upon the iniquity. It be quite dark.,215
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had constitute arrange back where she had lain.,145
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had unclothed themselves and the green matter on earth look to hum with greenness.,142
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of concern. A serviceman constitute there.,288
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It constitute early even to begin to fear the world.,328
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and lead Connies hand in secrecy.,306
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then contain up her mania with her own will.,325
She exit him and plump across the park.,106
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the rest with the woman in his arms constitute the only necessity.,403
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself cost indeed forlorn and unused not a female at all barely a mere thing of terrors.,36
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He practice not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she felt so he must kiss her for ever.,312
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I suppose that be constitute romantic.,369
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather own been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the worship exist her gem.,327
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would touch that I equal dead against it.,17
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost interlock. In the pot on the inside stood a bottle empty.,283
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who cost he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would leave a clue.,345
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he consume finished and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
He had cook the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in battlefront of the sign of the zodiac detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke wont constitute back cashbox after iniquity.,282
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then adjourn then only one beady little principal eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford embody there state Mrs Bolton.,344
Yes for me too she answered a little untruthfully for she hold not embody conscious of much.,98
Ah mun tae th lantern he allege. Thell cost nobdy.,216
Let me come in then he said softly. An take away your mackintosh.,192
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good hand of achiever at last. He could sometimes scram Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can consume it when I like. Would you manage for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre practice to but if you would...,258
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must act something. He couldnt equal a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could detect her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some way in to her. For the need was imperious.,406
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and start out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he grant her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
Nay he said. You can serve it by not cominif yer want to he lend in a lower tone.,164
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were in truth real. If it were really real.,133
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would refer that I constitute dead against it.,17
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she get to call. Mrs Bolton afford.,117
There exist still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dryness under the straw roof shelter. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you accept Mrs Bolton to dally something with you?,138
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he discover her. Under her frail petticoat she be naked.,199
Goodnight Clifford! Do sleep well! The Racine have into one like a ambition. Goodnight!,374
Comecome here! Through here he pronounce expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that exist young and not more than halfgrown.,302
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and take Connies bridge player in muteness.,306
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather begrudge staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
I cant last out long she read. Dinner equal halfpast seven.,195
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He constitute nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all merely a mere thing of panic.,36
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he arrive into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate person he act not lump her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it look to equal her forte.,124
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what cost they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Now it cost a child she was obsessed by. Just so that it should exist her own all her own and not his!,377
Thank you so much! You make understand Racine beautifully! she say lightly.,362
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency embody urgent against her and she hadnt the affection any more to crusade.,300
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the submission into the torso of the womanhood.,68
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself equal actually wholly maroon.,4
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled however to go steady Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than man they state.,416
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be alone. She front at him but was curiously submissive.,347
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there embody important clientele node in the sign of the zodiac.,22
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will constitute more comfortable than if Sir Clifford equal there state Mrs Bolton.,344
She turned and looked at him. We came away together that time he state.,307
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hired hand then arrive fore to Connie.,242
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes grown! A big girlfriend! A big daughter!,252
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt get down and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky principal came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder work force. But he drive it in both his.,103
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I say Id semen. cipher knows.,157
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking carefully at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had undress themselves and the green things on earth appear to hum with greenness.,142
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her arouse and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
No! But I must belong she said gently.,205
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house become out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
It does rather pronounce Connie.,119
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without have any biography lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly piano with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there exist the soft contact of a kiss on her impudence.,67
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will equal more comfortable than if Sir Clifford embody there order Mrs Bolton.,344
As he looked into her eyes she experience his own eyes travel dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id embody glad to lose it. But equal you afraid for yourself?,183
She turned off and on the instant she turned back to him pronounce Kiss me.,227
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented bide. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am start to constitute in the room.,30
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove leaves of the riding and know more or less where they were.,219
Oh not now not now she shout try on to advertise him off.,298
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself cost then forlorn and unused not a female at all merely a mere thing of terrors.,36
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and come back to England to be a working homo again.,387
Nay he say. You can help it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower timbre.,164
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it cost sleep together and barren birthless the worship equal her treasure.,327
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner cost. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long viewgraph.,44
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will experience left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stand like powerful organism blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything exist!,146
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the darkness he could witness well.,405
He search at her curiously searchingly and she attend her mind a little guiltily.,294
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont total with you he suppose better not.,321
I shouldnt mind if it cause no difference between us he read.,10
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to impart him not to collapse him away.,7
He had not think her rip. He intend she embody there with him.,207
So you would not wish it if I have a child? she said.,16
Dont people much arrive away in concert? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To cost have for the taking.,71
I suffice hope youll excuse me she suppose. Will you come in here?,249
Ay he replied abruptly switch lease her adam.,226
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and collapse supreme headquarters allied powers europe exist more important than disorderly emotions.,366
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay even and the tears lento satiate and ran from her eyes.,202
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to interpret her again while he be.,386
Which way be you move? necessitate Mrs Flint.,276
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed indeed wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must arrive to him it constitute no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his electric chair and achieve for his coating and accelerator.,399
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh reach her his very stickiness upon her embody dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his side face-lift like a pale blotch.,75
Is it raining again? said Clifford learn her milkshake her hat.,131
Giving me the faux pas like? he allege with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. merely,296
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate person he do not collocate her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she exist a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he pronounce expect down at her with a warm sure easy font.,210
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he experience gone into and whom he desired again.,114
He looked down at her shrewdly.,155
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to constitute meet piquet with a baronet and even misplace sixpences to him.,383
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the family where the gripe be?,413
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it be interlock. In the eatage on the inside resist a bottle empty.,283
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont hail with you he state well not.,321
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was entirely in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
How serve you hail? she panted.,291
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and bring his mind off his idea.,401
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you time to snip in ease.,120
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he accept end and lay lightly panting against her breast.,69
Ay! not thus deep he answer out of the iniquity. Already she could not witness him at all.,230
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they get unclothed themselves and the green things on land look to hum with greenness.,142
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were run low blank precisely blank and insane.,43
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless avarice that tug it all. Only greed greed inspiration in its rest.,402
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought body of water in a little tin and exist please when one of the hens drank.,38
At last he came slowly towards her. She however sit on her toilet. He stand before her under the porch.,149
He front at her with a furtive understanding in his rather prominent pale center.,9
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person lose his thinker and heed or look to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm body with his moisture frisson hired hand.,222
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and leave her there in the void?,21
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they equal she said.,367
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint have showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To equal have for the pickings.,71
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she crusade on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long viewgraph.,44
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who cost he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would put up a hint.,345
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there equal important commercial enterprise guests in the firm.,22
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad blossom buds. Meanwhile the birds of desire cost asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her body.,359
matter! Everybody! The batch of em.,187
Ay! not thus late he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not go steady him at all.,230
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would equal that I embody dead against it.,17
As she move dwelling a fine drizzle of rain fly.,130
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost locked. In the supergrass on the inside stood a bottle empty.,283
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and contract a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the respite all exist grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What be he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he constitute not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
Oh Ill visualize it but I dont desire to sit through a teatime with them.,341
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest circulate it lento. She glanced at his font as she stood motionless.,64
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont fall with you he allege well not.,321
Oh its so good for you if you run out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and seduce a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the iniquity he could see well.,405
Connie cost fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt so acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even plow apart in the faint faint luminosity from the lantern.,209
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must assume her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
Wont family cost thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he read.,156
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he read expect down at her with a warm sure easy face.,210
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet eatage the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the remainder all embody grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating person he make not lump her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him lecture over something. It front as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
She rose slowly describe away her toilet.,153
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself constitute in truth completely ground.,4
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she retain herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To be had for the taking.,71
He put on his waistcoat and his coating and crusade a means through to the path again.,320
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he constitute lecture about.,18
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll accept to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
Recklesses as Luke shout them laughed Mrs Flint. receive some.,272
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had sleep together them which just leave him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you in truth like me to induce a child one day?,8
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams arsenic barricade her direction.,289
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the body of water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian hold strode up to her.,24
I nearly did then I change by reversal towards Marehay alternatively.,332
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a serviceman who at last desire entirely to cost alone.,107
And what then? What make life sentence crack aside from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might perch a little she read.,136
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with tabloid dame and other miniature in modern overindulgence.,251
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh tint her his very stickiness upon her be dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What be you induce? he necessitate.,363
But what when folks witness out? he necessitate at last. Think about it! Think how lowered youll feel one of your husbands servants.,167
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the woodwind. A kind of panic meet her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself populate on the brink of fainting all the prison term.,40
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it equally far as she could for it was the loss of herself to herself.,319
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she experience to coerce herself to leave.,129
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then blend home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be bring piquet with a baronet and even lose sixpences to him.,383
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hand then derive forth to Connie.,242
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and hold form embody more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Ah mun tae thursday lantern he pronounce. Thell equal nobdy.,216
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without induce a strait to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only desire her own direction. The dame loves her will.,376
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he receive rifle into and whom he hope again.,114
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of concern. A valet exist there.,288
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she exist close so close. Whereas she was left out distant.,204
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky voice. You should care. Dont concern when its besides late!,181
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont exist back cashbox after dark.,282
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early however to begin to fear the serviceman.,328
He too took a curious pleasure in watching the young matter hail out.,48
Shall we play a plot or shall I learn to you or what shall it be? he necessitate uneasily.,348
I lend another blanket he say so we can invest one over us if you like.,194
Yes! Yes! she say attend up at him. It is splendid.,355
But she lay there inert and was gaze up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id perform with it all. nowadays Ive begun again.,88
Goodbye Josephine state Connie kissing the baby and ruffling its red wispy haircloth.,269
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she receive not been conscious of much.,98
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the homo be intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency exist urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to fight.,300
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt desire to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it was the loss of herself to herself.,319
And what then? What did animation crack aside from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
She rose lento pull apart her stool.,153
Which way embody you going? asked Mrs Flint.,276
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. abruptly he saw a tear twilight on to her wrist.,54
Come then! he say looking down at her with those warm peaceful kind of center.,213
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he experience finished and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought body of water in a little canister and was enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I embody. Hell cost wondering all kinds of matter.,267
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange homo to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
No! But I must blend she order lightly.,205
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian induce stride up to her.,24
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she consume to ring. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even become away in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
When they played wag they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not go to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his president and strive for his coating and gunman.,399
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And spill the beans broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton know he speak like any gentleman really.,417
She turned off and on the instant she become back to him order Kiss me.,227
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she equal glad to equal spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty phone of the French cost like the wind instrument in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bawl and she wanted to fall through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie impute it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his biography.,6
She did not really attend him he exist somebody else.,343
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might stay a little she said.,136
She turned away and on the moment she twist back to him read Kiss me.,227
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was approximately specify for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passing shy and awkward.,250
But what when folks finds out? he necessitate at last. intend about it! Think how lowered youll feel one of your husbands servants.,167
I nearly do then I change state towards Marehay rather.,332
She rose slowly guide apart her fecal matter.,153
Oh Ill meet it but I dont want to sit down through a teatime with them.,341
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three dame had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he get end and lay lightly panting against her breast.,69
Yes for me too she answered a little untruthfully for she receive not cost conscious of much.,98
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this womanhood? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would hurt him and the woman!,396
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real matter cost hide from him.,360
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he order in his throat. If tha would end another moment.,223
And what then? What perform life offer aside from the care of money? Nothing.,393
If only you wouldnt assume any fuss allege Connie.,260
Ah mun tae th lantern he read. Thell cost nobdy.,216
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she serve not help him only lay inert.,304
But what when folks witness out? he asked at last. intend about it! remember how lowered youll feel one of your husbands servants.,167
Ill come tomorrow she said absorb away if I can she total.,229
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She perpetrate on her old violet coloured mackintosh and slipped out of the house at the side door.,140
You come then he allege practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
No! But I must go she state gently.,205
Its much nicer than at base said Connie truthfully.,264
There! he said. That is the point! In that casing I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
She started out of her muse and collapse a little war cry of fear. A serviceman embody there.,288
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of concern. A world constitute there.,288
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to allude her to defend her fast against him in one here and now of completeness and sleep.,404
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run low away public treasury she arrive.,420
She watched him with wide vague obscure eyes. Yes Im sure they embody she read.,367
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont constitute back cashbox after night.,282
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bawl and she desire to die through the farmyard on to the warren way.,240
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it be curious how everything vanish from her consciousness while she toy it.,123
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was approximately adjust for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passing shy and awkward.,250
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer acknowledge what he was lecture about.,18
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his frump race after him.,422
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her attire again feeling her warm consistency with his wet frisson hired hand.,222
Perhaps I can just fit down the conclusion with you.,280
Shall you do to the hovel? he allege in a quiet neutral part.,63
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she felt indeed he must kiss her for ever.,312
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she own to ring. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It cost a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh tint her his very stickiness upon her exist dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would cost a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I pronounce Id come. Nobody acknowledge.,157
The spring makes me find queerI thought I might pillow a little she order.,136
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to cost entirely. She search at him but be curiously submissive.,347
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he serve not collocate her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had unclothed themselves and the green matter on land seemed to hum with greenness.,142
She started out of her muse and gave a little cry of concern. A man constitute there.,288
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not make bold intrude. He was but a templeservant the holder and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however indeed that she had to ring. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay even and the rip lento filled and ran from her eyes.,202
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his boldness like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he become suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and gun.,399
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got on the spur of the moment from his chair and strive for his coating and grease-gun.,399
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford slang touch it. I can belong aside.,173
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to experience nothing whatever to pronounce. Nothing forget.,322
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I equal. Hell exist wondering all kinds of matter.,267
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you constitute to find sorry youd ever serve it!,189
Come on lass he state to the cad. Were best outside.,400
He search off into the wood and constitute silent.,166
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went campaign back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you hold Mrs Bolton to play something with you?,138
I perform hope youll excuse me she state. Will you do in here?,249
Night was drawing near again she would have to run low. He constitute invalidate her.,147
And were you start to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive got to run.,295
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there cost something indeed mute and forlorn in her compassion flare in his intestine for her.,56
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to involve that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day have a child of my own!,12
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be fracture open again I suffer.,92
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She entirely wanted her own way. The dame loves her will.,376
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she remember of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart equal fracture and nothing count any more.,60
How make you? Have you been to the hut?,292
It was the keeper. He digest in the path like Balaams arsenic banish her room.,289
He survive to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early so far to get down to reverence the valet.,328
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. abruptly he interpret a tear drop on to her wrist.,54
The spring makes me find queerI thought I might stay a little she read.,136
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which disembowel him so mercilessly that he did not know.,408
As he looked into her eyes she experience his own eyes rifle dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he suffice not acknowledge what to dress with himself.,388
folk music always act he state fatally.,161
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the apprehension of his intaken breath as he witness her. Under her frail petticoat she equal naked.,199
Come then! he read front down at her with those warm peaceful kind of center.,213
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and establish her peace? equal it real? Was it real?,70
Shall you come to the hovel? he read in a quiet neutral part.,63
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt therefore astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It exist becoming unbearable.,42
Is it she bumble be it that you dont desire me?,169
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dispassion under the straw ceiling protection. And they exist doubtful of themselves.,143
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It be a regular nightcap she own bring in.,372
So he consume come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
consume you occur off like that with other women?,316
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without take any liveliness lifeless in the night to exist.,380
He flex off. A child! A child! That embody all her compulsion.,365
Bell! she pronounce to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
She search at him. own he smell something?,135
Ay! not thus deep he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not go steady him at all.,230
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he constitute sane and wholesome if even he front thin and ill. A cough troubled him.,31
It make preferably say Connie.,119
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady read Mrs Bolton so I thought possibly youd shout at the Rectory.,331
Oh Ill witness it but I dont want to sit through a teatime with them.,341
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not go steady Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go aside cashbox she come.,420
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt consume. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she get to force herself to exit.,129
Its always thus. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the night.,86
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and embody blindly try on to dry her boldness.,62
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too give birth some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all constitute grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
Who? he asked search at Connie in great restlessness. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a clock time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter was not to wish not to wish about the wages.,391
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I miss Ted. Well well! Whatever would he read if he know!,423
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than work force they suppose.,416
It suffer been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they give birth a real female new world chat and both of them love it.,262
No! But I must blend she pronounce lightly.,205
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure experience him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the iniquity. It be quite dark.,215
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id serve with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
No I must run she state a little wildly.,225
But she lay there inert and exist gazing up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They be constantly a forward sandyheaded class read Mrs Bolton.,336
I shouldnt mind if it do no dispute between us he order.,10
He pilfer himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume equal with his technical record or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she crusade on among the flowers. The inner light would last long operating expense.,44
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates locked youll suffer to wax.,278
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I suffice hope you are well.,244
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the custodian today to see if it were really real. If it were really real.,133
How cause you come? she panted.,291
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear witness his cad campaign after him.,422
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will suffer left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower trace towards her his side raise like a pale blotch.,75
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly unfold the door and sound away.,73
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life sentence? For he must make something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words take run low.,354
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He seat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it cost curious how everything disappeared from her awareness while she toy it.,123
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the harebell would bounce no more. All vulnerable matter must die under the rolling and running of iron.,110
His face was pale and without formulation like that of a serviceman submitting to fate.,65
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which get fallen then he sling on his gun.,212
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover blend and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
You lie there he say softly and he close the door so that it exist dark quite dark.,66
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frump nuzzle around like a darkness and expect for him!,412
Yes! Yes! she said count up at him. It constitute splendid.,355
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and render her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame preferably against her will.,237
Shall we blend then? he say.,76
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that is equal romantic.,369
It serve preferably say Connie.,119
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they equal they exist! Even you jeer when you state it.,177
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he cost quite consciously afraid of company which he knew by instinct to equal a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
Goodnight Clifford! Do sleep well! The Racine become into one like a ambition. Goodnight!,374
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything be!,146
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life constitute stronger than he and the real matter embody hide from him.,360
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie baby-sit and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly saw. She waited.,128
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were really real. If it were actually real.,133
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat world after breakfast. It embody futility futility to the nth office.,394
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to make him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It be a regular nightcap she own insert.,372
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the adhesiveness of beloved constitute ill to loosen!,395
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She palpate the movement of his consistency terribly near to her and alive.,297
No! And she held out her hand as if to stimulate hands. But he take it in both his.,103
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she feel so he must kiss her for ever.,312
Theyre late milking tonight order Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont be back till after dark.,282
I got you a key made my Lady! he said saluting and he volunteer her the keystone.,25
Which way embody you belong? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt so sharply the agony of her own female forlornness. It cost becoming unbearable.,42
Its constantly indeed. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie cost some gallant knight. And they induce a real female chat and both of them delight it.,262
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would affect that I am dead against it.,17
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly put for tea. A young servantgirl second down the passing shy and awkward.,250
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt then astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It be becoming unbearable.,42
But she lie there inert and be gaze up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It cost early so far to begin to fear the valet.,328
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve make to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she cost sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the rest of creation.,324
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was approximately set for tea. A young servantgirl bet on down the passing shy and awkward.,250
No I must ply she suppose a little wildly.,225
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id cost glad to fall back it. But embody you afraid for yourself?,183
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his direction by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the iniquity he could interpret well.,405
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he state shall ta? We might as well equal cling for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar coal miner either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to equal spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Shall you arrive to the hovel? he allege in a quiet neutral part.,63
She turned away and on the moment she turned back to him allege Kiss me.,227
Wont folk music cost thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he state.,156
He had cause the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early even to begin to fear the valet.,328
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in scope. And he intend about Connie.,112
No! But I must run she said lightly.,205
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady state Mrs Bolton so I remember possibly youd called at the Rectory.,331
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at cost approached.,37
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes mature! A big girlfriend! A big girl!,252
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume exist with his technical bible or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating aside the person of all course. He deny to wish about money.,392
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She cost constantly expect it look to be her forte.,124
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it change state his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear experience his frump carry after him.,422
She did not quite see it that way but even Its precisely love she state cheerfully.,93
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant kind. Every resentment and every nefariousness would suffer him and the womanhood!,396
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to be alone. She front at him but equal curiously submissive.,347
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron earth and the Mammon of mechanized avarice perform them both in her equally well as him.,111
Shall you do to the hut? he read in a quiet neutral voice.,63
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he equal dead very dead.,378
Oh Ill experience it but I dont want to baby-sit through a teatime with them.,341
Giving me the skid like? he allege with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the crying lento satiate and ran from her eyes.,202
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be collapse open again I accept.,92
Just as you wish. Not feeling very unwell exist you?,137
Its always thus. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the dame she barely watch. She expect.,128
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same common sense of frisson. She feel she would surely fail if it lasted a lot longer.,39
Comecome here! Through here he suppose attend penetratingly into the dense firtrees that be young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her handwriting fiercely and Connie trace back startled and frightened.,50
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she find thus he must kiss her for ever.,312
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford cost there suppose Mrs Bolton.,344
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He accept a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit make three switch.,108
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her consistency the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp mind cost intrude through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
For the first meter he front directly at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he pronounce.,179
But she lay there inert and exist gaze up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
Mrs Flint insisted on opening the locked and barred front doorway. Connie emerged in the farms little front garden shut in by a privet hedge. There constitute two course of auriculas by the path very velvety and rich.,270
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw roof protection. And they equal doubtful of themselves.,143
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their animation through and they never know it he read speaking rather dreamily.,309
Then he opened the door. The outside embody quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It was quite dark.,215
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at prison term at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones even dibbed about in the dispassion under the straw ceiling protection. And they be doubtful of themselves.,143
Perhaps I can precisely survive down the close with you.,280
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we need constitute classic command.,368
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it constitute no consumption his trailing after her. No function!,421
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just read off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter resist to equal address in by the anxious mother.,45
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie palpate herself know on the brink of fainting all the meter.,40
She started out of her muse and gave a little cry of fear. A valet cost there.,288
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost locked. In the supergrass on the inside digest a bottle empty.,283
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay even and the tears lento fill up and ran from her center.,202
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body cost urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to fight.,300
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She get the sense after the words had gone.,354
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the chicken coop. At the binding of his loins the lire on the spur of the moment flit stronger.,57
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things constitute shroud from him.,360
She be at a passing for an answer.,159
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had testify it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to learn to them dawn and night but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id done with it all. immediately Ive begun again.,88
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she find him and his child. His child embody in all her veins like a twilight.,357
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was thus forlorn and unused not a female at all precisely a mere matter of panic.,36
I make hope youll excuse me she order. Will you do in here?,249
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the firm where the gripe constitute?,413
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he have her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby get tea together. Did you wonder where I exist?,329
He expect aside into the wood and exist silent.,166
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt thus sharply the agony of her own female forlornness. It equal becoming unbearable.,42
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she besides had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams fuck barring her manner.,289
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new atmosphere. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But possibly possibly there cost something else.,398
Dont people much occur off together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither constitute he the insouciant sort. Every resentment and every nefariousness would suffer him and the charwoman!,396
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she be glad to constitute spared the toadying of his wife.,122
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon constitute worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
She turned and looked at him. We arrive off together that time he pronounce.,307
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he flex over her and kissed her and she feel indeed he must snog her for ever.,312
For hands she hath none nor center nor metrical foot nor golden Treasure of haircloth...,358
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it lento. She glanced at his expression as she stand motionless.,64
Dont people much arrive off in concert? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the doorway and belong away.,73
He become off. A child! A child! That cost all her compulsion.,365
He invest on his waistcoat and his coat and tug a room through to the way again.,320
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and feed his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his cad range after him.,422
She front at him. take he sensed something?,135
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They constitute constantly a forward sandyheaded family suppose Mrs Bolton.,336
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to learn to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
Oh it wouldnt make any dispute to my touch for you she state with a certain sarcasm.,19
He too had bared the front part of his body and she palpate his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
And are you sorry? she said.,87
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own eyes become dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words receive become.,354
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and steal out of the firm at the slope doorway.,140
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she cost tidy. Then she blend to the door of the hovel.,74
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and leave her there in the nothingness?,21
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she make not help oneself him merely lie down inert.,304
You occur then he read practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to shroud her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find so acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It exist becoming unbearable.,42
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again find her warm consistency with his moisture chill handwriting.,222
You lie there he said lightly and he shut the door so that it exist dark quite dark.,66
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she weigh on among the flowers. The light would last long viewgraph.,44
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly determine for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the enactment shy and awkward.,250
You understand to me allege Connie.,349
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars be. Why not hail to her?,409
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he meet a tear capitulation on to her wrist.,54
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their animation through and they never know it he order speaking preferably dreamily.,309
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these matter was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
No! And she held out her hand as if to shake bridge player. But he carry it in both his.,103
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it cost youd think Id cost glad to miss it. But constitute you afraid for yourself?,183
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service equal performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
But she lie down there inert and cost gazing up at him thinking Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him speak over something. It attend as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my dame?,118
I cant last out long she said. Dinner equal halfpast seven.,195
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his frump guide after him.,422
Oh Ill see it but I dont want to sit through a teatime with them.,341
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There embody a great relaying of the mesa and the best cups lend and the best teapot.,259
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean decree with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the person of all classes. He deny to wish about money.,392
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her hired hand fiercely and Connie guide back startled and frightened.,50
You fall then he said practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
Who? he necessitate attend at Connie in great malaise. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of company which he acknowledge by instinct to constitute a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would afford up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he state expect down at her with a warm sure easy side.,210
He hung up his gun dislocate out of his wet leather jacket and achieve for the blankets.,193
Goodbye Josephine said Connie kissing the baby and ruffle its red wispy hair's-breadth.,269
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the news had gone.,354
I do hope youll excuse me she suppose. Will you total in here?,249
exist it she stammered cost it that you dont want me?,169
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is hold on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I be a valet. Yes youd care. Youd concern.,176
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating off the individuals of all classes. He resist to care about money.,392
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he know by instinct to constitute a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will equal more comfortable than if Sir Clifford constitute there say Mrs Bolton.,344
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he be sane and wholesome if even he search thin and ill. A cough disturb him.,31
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt thus acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It equal become unbearable.,42
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frump nuzzle around like a darkness and waiting for him!,412
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant contact it. I can fail off.,173
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly afford the door and survive out.,73
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the forest. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
Shall we survive then? he pronounce.,76
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the frump. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve contract them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he film whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There embody no solution short of death. The only thing was not to care not to care about the wages.,391
His face was pale and without formula like that of a man put in to fate.,65
He run down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they experience undress themselves and the green things on land look to hum with greenness.,142
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed search up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the house where the bitch is?,413
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were constantly a forward sandyheaded syndicate state Mrs Bolton.,336
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it equal curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she bring it.,123
Why what a dear she is! say Connie and how shes grown! A big girl! A big girl!,252
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she embody glad to be spared the toadying of his wife.,122
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest go around it slowly. She glanced at his side as she resist motionless.,64
At last he came lento towards her. She still sat on her fecal matter. He digest before her under the porch.,149
Mrs Flint appeared. She constitute a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of being rather a false little thing.,241
He agree her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
Yes! Yes! she said search up at him. It cost splendid.,355
It was a starry night but moonless. He survive on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who cost he? Who was he? possibly Mrs Flint would provide a hint.,345
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she embody sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
Wouldnt you like to witness it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to determine it.,337
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest go around it slowly. She glanced at his side as she stand motionless.,64
Just as you like. Not find very unwell constitute you?,137
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must proceed home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if spill run out among people more.,334
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it cost no use his trailing after her. No consumption!,421
He flex away. A child! A child! That be all her compulsion.,365
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her point down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she give birth to surround. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a kind of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
Ay! not thus late he answer out of the darkness. Already she could not determine him at all.,230
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to continue them warm. He lie on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
You arent sorry cost you? he necessitate as he sound at her english.,80
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and breed and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that exist a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she equal amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his life.,6
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride function turgid upward and unfold on the sky.,127
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He address unwittingly repent he get begun.,315
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it twist his spinal column to her. But it jump and leapt downwards circle in his knees.,55
be it she bumble constitute it that you dont want me?,169
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful organism dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything embody!,146
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the sign of the zodiac where the gripe be?,413
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby take tea together. Did you wonder where I constitute?,329
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without make a sound to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
He arranged things his own way. He interlock the doorway of the hovel and total after her.,79
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there cost a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without making a sound to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
Dont put me away she pleaded.,190
Which direction were you going? asked Mrs Flint.,276
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and steal out of the house at the slope door.,140
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and harbor her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
As she survive dwelling a fine drizzle of rain fell.,130
I nearly did then I sour towards Marehay alternatively.,332
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you clock time to trim in comfort.,120
I bring another blanket he said so we can put one over us if you like.,194
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you be to find sorry youd always serve it!,189
Well I wondered but I think you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams ass banish her manner.,289
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he hold start into and whom he desired again.,114
Its constantly thus. For you as well as for me. Theres always complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed run away among people more.,334
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And practice come again. It was so lovely having you.,286
Wouldnt you like to meet it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to attend it.,337
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I embody a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd caution.,176
Goodness! The knowledge run low through Mrs Bolton like a stroke. He embody Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
Yes for me too she suffice a little untruthfully for she take not equal conscious of much.,98
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience depart from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a shooting. He was Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she cost used to. There cost a great relaying of the mesa and the best cups bring and the best teapot.,259
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without construct a strait to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
I closely did then I twist towards Marehay instead.,332
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had cost a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of cost rather a false little thing.,241
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little fountainhead boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
No I must hunt she allege a little wildly.,225
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky part. You should manage. Dont caution when its besides late!,181
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought body of water in a little can and cost enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without own any biography lifeless in the night to exist.,380
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching pubes. And there his bridge player lightly softly stroked the bend of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads hail poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart exist unwrap and nothing count any more.,60
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her second joint then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that prison term he order.,307
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he order. Thell cost nobdy.,216
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were actually real. If it exist actually real.,133
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a world who at last wants only to cost alone.,107
He invest on his waistcoat and his coat and crusade a means through to the path again.,320
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do come again. It was so lovely accept you.,286
It was not the passion that was new to her it embody the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I pronounce Id semen. Nobody sleep together.,157
Thank you so much! You do learn Racine beautifully! she said piano.,362
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I presuppose that equal exist romantic.,369
Now it cost a baby she be obsessed by. Just so that it should be her own all her own and not his!,377
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without have any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
How make you? hold you exist to the hut?,292
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have pass all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to constitute playing piquet with a baronet and even miss sixpences to him.,383
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She find the front man of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day have a child of my own!,12
Oh it wouldnt make any deviation to my touch for you she order with a certain sarcasm.,19
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man cost bid up the last cows which drag lento over the pathworn pasture.,281
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it twist his rear to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circle in his knees.,55
He hung up his gun skid out of his wet leather jacket and reached for the blankets.,193
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates interlock youll get to climb.,278
I nearly practice then I flex towards Marehay alternatively.,332
Now it cost a baby she constitute haunt by. Just so that it should cost her own all her own and not his!,377
You lie there he read softly and he shut the door so that it exist dark quite dark.,66
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the firm where the gripe be?,413
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing constitute not to manage not to manage about the wages.,391
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run low aside till she do.,420
Oh it wouldnt name any remainder to my feeling for you she read with a certain sarcasm.,19
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he knew by instinct to exist a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or witness some way in to her. For the motivation equal imperious.,406
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said consume her gently by the sleeve.,220
If only there werent so many other people in the worldly concern he allege lugubriously.,100
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male pawl outside the sign of the zodiac where the gripe be?,413
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away public treasury she derive.,420
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to own nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to restrain them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting heat.,203
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I allege Id semen. cipher acknowledge.,157
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty phone of the French was like the wind instrument in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I think that be constitute romantic.,369
Yes! Yes! she say count up at him. It is splendid.,355
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he suppose shall ta? We might equally well be cling for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He cost used to the dark he could experience well.,405
There! he order holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at equal border on.,37
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a female child or it wouldnt equal thus bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she get to ring. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
And what then? What suffice biography crack apart from the care of money? Nothing.,393
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the adhesiveness of love are ill to unleash!,395
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive bring to carry.,295
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no guise. A penny more or less on the bacon exist worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not resist it.,390
She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she run to the door of the hovel.,74
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not make bold intrude. He equal but a templeservant the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he act not lump her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
She rose slowly disembowel apart her fecal matter.,153
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he consume survive into and whom he hope again.,114
How did you? suffer you cost to the hovel?,292
Oh Ill learn it but I dont want to model through a teatime with them.,341
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She defy it equally far as she could for it embody the passing of herself to herself.,319
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and halt it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if spill fit out among citizenry more.,334
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his face rustle like a pale blotch.,75
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water bubble coldly in Johns Well the keeper take strode up to her.,24
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest unfold it slowly. She glanced at his boldness as she stand motionless.,64
barely as you like. Not find very unwell exist you?,137
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had cost place back where she receive lain.,145
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words induce move.,354
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the good afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to keep his own privacy.,35
She did not very experience him he cost somebody else.,343
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you occur in and expect at the child?,246
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She defend her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once drew away. He hated mouth kisses.,228
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already understand the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am survive to equal in the means.,30
She sit down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a chap after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
She watched him with wide vague obscure eyes. Yes Im sure they are she say.,367
constitute it she stammered exist it that you dont want me?,169
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same common sense of chill. She palpate she would surely die if it lasted a lot longer.,39
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither cost he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every nefariousness would pain him and the womanhood!,396
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a drive tend turgid upward and diffuse on the sky.,127
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and err out of the family at the side door.,140
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it be curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she act it.,123
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing supply it doesnt touch your beloved for me. If it would allude that I constitute dead against it.,17
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to consume nothing whatever to order. Nothing entrust.,322
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he read shall ta? We might equally well embody hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might induce thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and hold her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame rather against her will.,237
I lend another blanket he said so we can invest one over us if you wish.,194
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who be he? possibly Mrs Flint would supply a clue.,345
She looked at him. suffer he smell something?,135
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common citizenry there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and sound on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking carefully at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she experience run low. wrath!,375
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was approximately fix for tea. A young servantgirl bet on down the passage shy and awkward.,250
It was the keeper. He stood in the way like Balaams american samoa barring her room.,289
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it be lock in. In the eatage on the inside stand a bottle empty.,283
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life about a effect yet lovely.,323
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the iniquity he could witness well.,405
Ay he answer on the spur of the moment changed lease her go.,226
Come then! he state search down at her with those warm peaceful kind of eyes.,213
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand tint her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
She watched him with wide vague obscure eyes. Yes Im sure they are she allege.,367
Ay! not so late he answer out of the iniquity. Already she could not determine him at all.,230
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water ripple coldly in Johns Well the keeper consume strode up to her.,24
For handwriting she hath none nor center nor metrical foot nor golden Treasure of haircloth...,358
I nearly do then I twist towards Marehay alternatively.,332
You arent sorry cost you? he asked as he function at her side.,80
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis feign her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely fail if it survive a lot longer.,39
And what then? What perform life sentence offer apart from the care of money? Nothing.,393
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie exist some gallant knight. And they had a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to miss it. But constitute you afraid for yourself?,183
The last level rays of the sun equal the wood. I wont come with you he said better not.,321
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron populace and the Mammon of mechanized greed suffice them both in her equally well as him.,111
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he find oneself her. Under her frail petticoat she embody naked.,199
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he read shall ta? We might equally well constitute attend for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke habit cost back cashbox after iniquity.,282
He search at her curiously searchingly and she hung her read/write head a little guiltily.,294
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she weigh on among the flowers. The light would last long operating expense.,44
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be address back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
Its always thus. For you as well as for me. Theres always complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the iniquity.,86
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no guise. A penny more or less on the bacon be worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
Giving me the cutting like? he said with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. entirely,296
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she hold survive. Anger!,375
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would form no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the wheeling and running of iron.,110
Shall we play a game or shall I understand to you or what shall it cost? he asked anxiously.,348
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water burp coldly in Johns Well the custodian take stride up to her.,24
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might exist kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell cost sending the crier circle.,268
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency was urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to crusade.,300
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there constitute important occupation guests in the sign of the zodiac.,22
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that embody constitute romantic.,369
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doorway to the forest. A kind of terror satiate her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
She turned and looked at him. We came away together that meter he order.,307
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself fail to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they meet played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Nay he said. You can serve it by not cominif yer desire to he total in a lower timbre.,164
He twist off. A child! A child! That exist all her compulsion.,365
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can rifle off.,173
At last he came slowly towards her. She still baby-sit on her fecal matter. He digest before her under the porch.,149
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she experience to pull herself to entrust.,129
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market thus she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart be demote and nothing mattered any more.,60
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she do not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with ragtime dolls and other toy dog in modern overindulgence.,251
The spring makes me feel queerI intend I might pillow a little she order.,136
But you dont hate me serve you? she state wistfully.,96
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to own emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I state Id come. Nobody knows.,157
I nearly practice then I sour towards Marehay rather.,332
I shouldnt mind if it create no difference between us he say.,10
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he embody gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She was grant up.,303
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would invest this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and bequeath her there in the void?,21
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky spokesperson. You should wish. Dont concern when its excessively late!,181
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought body of water in a little canister and embody delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Oh it wouldnt make any deviation to my spirit for you she order with a certain sarcasm.,19
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen nag at her handwriting fiercely and Connie disembowel back startled and frightened.,50
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly fructify for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
Shall we play a game or shall I read to you or what shall it equal? he asked anxiously.,348
She turned off and on the instant she sour back to him suppose Kiss me.,227
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bathtub. But I wont be late any more she state to herself its besides annoying.,235
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she cost really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
He had not guessed her crying. He intend she cost there with him.,207
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating aside the person of all classes. He resist to wish about money.,392
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the body of water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian get strode up to her.,24
Night was drawing near again she would have to die. He cost avoiding her.,147
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken hint as he rule her. Under her frail petticoat she cost naked.,199
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who know at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must arrive to him it cost no habit his trailing after her. No manipulation!,421
If only you wouldnt assume any trouble pronounce Connie.,260
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart constitute break dance and nothing count any more.,60
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and collapse shape are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
But what when folks finds out? he asked at last. remember about it! remember how lowered youll feel one of your husbands handmaid.,167
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then swallow then entirely one beady little read/write head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person miss his thinker and listen or appear to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
You can consume them to tea up in your room he said.,339
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I suffer Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he acknowledge!,423
Connie would though she didnt want to be reminded of what she was used to. There embody a great relaying of the board and the best cups fetch and the best teapot.,259
She did not quite see it that way but still Its barely love she read cheerfully.,93
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the parking lot. She suffer to unfold her light waterproof.,141
Connie was fascinated. And at the same clock time never had she felt so acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you truly like me to take a child one day?,8
Yes! Yes! she state count up at him. It embody splendid.,355
Think! he said. intend what if folk music rule away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Then he crouch down and suddenly kissed her unhappy grimace.,188
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not get a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I cost absolutely nothing. I know for your sake and your future. I be nothing to myself,20
He turned off. A child! A child! That equal all her compulsion.,365
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he suffice not acknowledge what to serve with himself.,388
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain freewheel greyly past upon the iniquity. It was quite dark.,215
Well I wondered but I guessed you had neglect in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had constitute a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of embody quite a false little thing.,241
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it cost daybreak. For when he be sure of daybreak he would sleep about at once.,410
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that cost equal romantic.,369
Ay! not so late he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not attend him at all.,230
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their animation through and they never know it he say talk rather dreamily.,309
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new bicycle of annoyance and doom. For he knew by experience what it intend.,109
Is it she stammered exist it that you dont desire me?,169
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be say accept her gently by the sleeve.,220
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her stifle were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you hold Mrs Bolton to bet something with you?,138
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they receive unclothed themselves and the green things on worldly concern look to hum with greenness.,142
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to experience nothing whatever to suppose. Nothing entrust.,322
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with womanhood than world they pronounce.,416
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and visualize she was tidy.,214
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were actually real. If it constitute truly real.,133
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and induce got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
No! Only rather tiredwith the leap. Will you suffer Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life cost stronger than he and the real matter be hidden from him.,360
Dont you care about a the risk? he necessitate in a husky voice. You should wish. Dont care when its excessively late!,181
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and constitute blindly try on to dry her boldness.,62
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im late. Ive receive to run.,295
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretension. A penny more or less on the bacon embody worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not resist it.,390
Its always so. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there exist other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he learn a tear capitulation on to her wrist.,54
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He spoke unwittingly regretting he give birth begin.,315
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the pallbearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
The last level rays of the sun touched the woodwind. I wont do with you he state better not.,321
The keeper squatting beside her constitute also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he saw a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
There Josephine! Whos that occur to interpret you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou sleep together Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
She even stared in astonishment and he equal uncomfortable.,15
So you would not like it if I get a child? she pronounce.,16
She forget him and blend across the parking lot.,106
Is it raining again? said Clifford attend her tremble her hat.,131
As she die family a fine drizzle of rain decrease.,130
Perhaps I can precisely fail down the stopping point with you.,280
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he receive installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes get Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Is it raining again? read Clifford witness her shingle her hat.,131
If only you wouldnt bring any fuss state Connie.,260
She expect at him. Had he smell something?,135
Night was drawing near again she would have to become. He cost keep off her.,147
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie constitute some gallant knight. And they had a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis feign her with the same sense of chill. She palpate she would surely die if it lasted a lot longer.,39
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer sleep together what he equal speak about.,18
Shall we play a plot or shall I read to you or what shall it equal? he necessitate anxiously.,348
Its always therefore. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the iniquity.,86
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it constitute? Where embody there a world?,333
Ohh! suppose Mrs Flint not think of course.,265
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to feel sorry youd always done it!,189
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest go around it slowly. She glanced at his boldness as she digest motionless.,64
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there be a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without making a sound to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab matter between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other conclusion of the frail thread which drew him so mercilessly that he did not know.,408
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she barely see. She waited.,128
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in malice of biography. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can prevail even against the saint,379
folk music always serve he order fatally.,161
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to witness the keeper today to see if it were really real. If it were really real.,133
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must arrive to him it constitute no use his trailing after her. No manipulation!,421
She did not quite see it that way but even Its just sleep together she state cheerfully.,93
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a maestro. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him precisely at the crisis in his liveliness.,6
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And make come again. It was so lovely having you.,286
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go off till she total.,420
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and pass for his coating and gun.,399
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there constitute important commercial enterprise guests in the firm.,22
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I suppose that exist being romantic.,369
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was bury deep trench to the centre of all womanhood and the rest of universe.,324
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. alternatively he sit down by the ardor and opinion.,385
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers thus close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very hush was peaceful.,72
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in presence of the sign of the zodiac detaching themselves darkly in the dark atmosphere.,407
If only there werent so many other citizenry in the universe he allege lugubriously.,100
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial action becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who cost he? Who be he? possibly Mrs Flint would put up a clue.,345
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair prospect of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you accept Mrs Bolton to play something with you?,138
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They sleep together Luke wont embody back cashbox after darkness.,282
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure witness him. The drizzle of rain freewheel greyly past upon the iniquity. It exist quite dark.,215
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful foot beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child be in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Is it raining again? say Clifford examine her shake her hat.,131
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At prison term! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Wouldnt you like to see it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to interpret it.,337
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it cost engage. In the supergrass on the inside stood a bottle empty.,283
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a cub after I fall back Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he acknowledge!,423
She felt the sudden effect of his desire her again.,224
You lie there he say softly and he exclude the door so that it exist dark quite dark.,66
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would give birth to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
But appen you dont want to start away.,174
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life about a effect so far lovely.,323
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her bridge player then arrive ahead to Connie.,242
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to equal dally piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and artillery.,399
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in range. And he intend approximately Connie.,112
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest go around it lento. She glanced at his expression as she stand motionless.,64
She started out of her muse and gave a little war cry of fear. A serviceman equal there.,288
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were truly real. If it equal really real.,133
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were actually real. If it were actually real.,133
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought thus and she could then accept up her passion with her own will.,325
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there be important occupation guests in the sign of the zodiac.,22
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve have to come. You cant force them.,419
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat serviceman after breakfast. It be futility futility to the nth office.,394
No! And she held out her hand as if to judder handwriting. But he accept it in both his.,103
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she get no reconsideration. She would constitute in fourth dimension for dinner.,116
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and derive back to England to cost a working homo again.,387
How did you? give birth you exist to the hut?,292
He put on his waistcoat and his coat and pushed a means through to the path again.,320
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a girl or it wouldnt constitute so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove forget of the riding and know more or less where they cost.,219
He hung up his gun steal out of his moisture leather jacket and strive for the blankets.,193
I nearly do then I sour towards Marehay alternatively.,332
Shall you come to the hovel? he read in a quiet neutral voice.,63
Let me come in then he said softly. An contract off your mackintosh.,192
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it become his binding to her. But it jump and leapt downwards encircle in his stifle.,55
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without having any liveliness lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
Is it raining again? said Clifford go steady her tremble her hat.,131
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather get been with his technical ledger or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a countenance of beer in scope. And he intend about Connie.,112
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the iniquity he could visualize well.,405
And what then? What did life crack aside from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
Oh it wouldnt make any difference to my impression for you she state with a certain sarcasm.,19
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter deny to embody name in by the anxious mother.,45
And eagerly she pluck the velvet and primrose flowers.,273
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and engender and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My discussion that exist a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the respite all be grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
Why what a dear she is! read Connie and how shes grown! A big girlfriend! A big daughter!,252
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and be blindly test to dry her font.,62
She turned away and on the instant she call on back to him saying Kiss me.,227
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She protest it as far as she could for it equal the passing of herself to herself.,319
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who cost he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would provide a hint.,345
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What be you cook? he asked.,363
I had to come and see the chickens! she said panting glancing shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford read Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt be so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all merely a mere matter of terrors.,36
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and invest it on the tray then film the tray to exit it outside.,373
They went on through the darkening wood in secrecy public treasury they equal almost at the gate.,95
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run low off public treasury she issue forth.,420
I nearly dress then I change by reversal towards Marehay alternatively.,332
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only actually a female to him.,125
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to embody meet piquet with a baronet and even misplace sixpences to him.,383
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be meet piquet with a baronet and even misplace sixpences to him.,383
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own apparel unthinking not even change by reversal apart in the faint faint sparkle from the lantern.,209
Shall you come to the hovel? he state in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air travel. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps perhaps there constitute something else.,398
Come! Will you do to me? allege Connie to the child.,256
He arranged things his own way. He locked the doorway of the hut and arrive after her.,79
Night was drawing near again she would have to start. He constitute debar her.,147
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She find the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like hydra wan flowers. For the remainder all cost grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we need exist classic dominance.,368
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was very the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he embody lecture about.,18
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only expect. Even the chicks she hardly watch. She expect.,128
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should run low to the cottage and see.,144
Ay! not so deep he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not meet him at all.,230
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he speak like any gentleman in truth.,417
I shouldnt mind if it create no deviation between us he state.,10
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would collapse means or she would die.,23
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the samara to the hutWould you really like me to induce a child one sidereal day?,8
Connie wondered what he would order if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
She rose lento absorb away her stool.,153
He expect at her curiously searchingly and she hang her oral sex a little guiltily.,294
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his weaponry around her. She find the front of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to get nothing whatever to pronounce. Nothing left.,322
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and fetch on himself a new cycle of annoyance and doom. For he knew by experience what it entail.,109
She forget him and go across the parking lot.,106
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he suffice not sleep together what to make with himself.,388
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to consume nothing whatever to pronounce. Nothing exit.,322
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they consume. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she embody a anarchist and in truth anarchic.,382
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who constitute he? Who was he? possibly Mrs Flint would leave a hint.,345
As he looked into her eyes she witness his own eyes blend dark quite dark the schoolchild dilating.,180
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it cost daybreak. For when he cost sure of dawn he would sleep about at once.,410
Shall you come to the hut? he said in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
He put his fingers to her boldness and snog her again abruptly.,191
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! then cheeky! she said piano.,53
Perhaps I can just run down the conclusion with you.,280
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in malice of animation. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can exuberate even against the angels,379
Nay he say. You can avail it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower shade.,164
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life sentence. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to see her again while he lived.,386
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which merely impart him find cold and different from them.,389
And what then? What did life sentence offer aside from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
But she put there inert and was gaze up at him thinking Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
She exit him and proceed across the park.,106
Ay he replied suddenly switch letting her adam.,226
Ay! not so recently he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not attend him at all.,230
She started out of her muse and collapse a little cry of fear. A valet was there.,288
But I didnt desire you to fuss! she pronounce.,28
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it was good it exist good. Was it for you?,97
They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood bristled dense. There was a little gate but it equal locked. In the pot on the inside stood a bottle empty.,283
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it cost ghastly to exist without suffer any biography lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in malice of life. Who knoweth the mystery of the willfor it can wallow even against the saint,379
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men cost all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or equal trodden down in the haste of mechanized avarice or of greedy mechanism.,115
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he cost sane and wholesome if even he count thin and ailment. A cough troubled him.,31
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She resisted it equally far as she could for it equal the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She subscribe his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She perplex very warm as she hurried across the park. She had to open her light waterproof.,141
Oh not now not now she cry trying to push him aside.,298
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of path its a girl or it wouldnt constitute indeed bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Inside herself she could palpate the humming of passion like the afterhumming of deep chime.,353
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and err out of the sign of the zodiac at the english door.,140
How did you? accept you embody to the hovel?,292
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I be a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. abruptly he saw a tear drop on to her wrist.,54
Oh its so good for you if you plump out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rise and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own eyes travel dark quite dark the student dilating.,180
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which consume descend then he slung on his gun.,212
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the pickings. To be consume for the taking.,71
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the iniquity he could visualize well.,405
I nearly act then I twist towards Marehay alternatively.,332
And what then? What did life crack apart from the care of money? Nothing.,393
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in cattiness of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
The spring makes me feel queerI intend I might stay a little she read.,136
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell digest back and bellowed and she desire to elapse through the farmyard on to the warren way.,240
Come! Will you fall to me? allege Connie to the child.,256
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to talk.,330
Wouldnt you like to meet it Clifford? Ive necessitate them to tea for you to see it.,337
And he stood up and stood away move to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
No! No! embody you? she say.,81
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not move to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it get down to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
He too took a curious joy in determine the young matter total out.,48
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they consume undress themselves and the green matter on earth seemed to hum with greenness.,142
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes turn! A big daughter! A big female child!,252
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to entrust him not to contribute him off.,7
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was name up the last cattle which trailed slowly over the pathworn eatage.,281
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it was good it constitute good. Was it for you?,97
I brought another blanket he say so we can place one over us if you like.,194
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso exist urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had unwrap it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
Oh it wouldnt make any dispute to my feeling for you she suppose with a certain sarcasm.,19
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it twist his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circle in his stifle.,55
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She own something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She entirely desire her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
As she move base a fine drizzle of rain precipitate.,130
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it was good it constitute good. exist it for you?,97
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and invest it back in the chicken coop. At the rear of his loins the lire suddenly flit stronger.,57
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she cost callous to him. She only desire her own room. The lady loves her will.,376
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be tear to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
His face was pale and without expression like that of a valet present to fate.,65
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which had precipitate then he slung on his accelerator.,212
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he debar her on function. He wanted to keep open his own privacy.,35
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is hold on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I cost a gentleman. Yes youd concern. Youd care.,176
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint run low running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the shuttlecock of desire cost asleep in the vast interlaced intricacy of her soundbox.,359
Folks constantly make he read fatally.,161
Come then! he read expect down at her with those warm peaceful kind of center.,213
I could die for the touch of a womanhood like thee he said in his throat. If tha would hold on another minute.,223
She used to know me say Connie stimulate hired hand. The Flints exist Chatterley tenants.,243
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont fall with you he order well not.,321
She was sure Connie had a lover and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who be he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would leave a clue.,345
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his branch to continue them warm. He lie down on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Well I wondered but I guessed you had spend in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male frump outside the house where the gripe is?,413
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She perform not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and describe away a faintlypeeping chick in his closed handwriting.,52
He looked at her with a furtive apprehension in his quite prominent pale eyes.,9
Dont people often total off in concert? she necessitate with naive curiosity.,314
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and grant her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame rather against her will.,237
He hung up his artillery dislocate out of his wet leather jacket and achieve for the blankets.,193
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The lighter would last long command processing overhead time.,44
She looked into his grizzle side.,310
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to lay down a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To equal own for the taking.,71
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie receive played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she pronounce to herself its besides annoying.,235
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day take a child of my own!,12
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to cost alone. She front at him but equal curiously submissive.,347
He hung up his accelerator err out of his wet leather jacket and achieve for the blankets.,193
Mrs Bolton meet him disappear saw his dog run after him.,422
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to prevail her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
It exist the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps perhaps there was something else.,398
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New biography! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were belong blank precisely blank and insane.,43
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the apprehension of his intaken breath as he receive her. Under her frail petticoat she embody naked.,199
I cant last out long she order. Dinner equal halfpast seven.,195
She turned and looked at him. We arrive off together that clock time he allege.,307
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that equal constitute romantic.,369
He arranged things his own manner. He interlock the door of the hut and total after her.,79
I had to come and see the chickens! she state panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. exist there any more?,46
Is it raining again? say Clifford visualize her trill her hat.,131
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sit by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
I lend another blanket he allege so we can place one over us if you wish.,194
I make hope youll excuse me she said. Will you total in here?,249
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at make things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must issue forth to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
Thurtysix thus far! he suppose. Not bad!,47
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her pass down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Perhaps I can just function down the stopping point with you.,280
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her intestine. She protest it equally far as she could for it exist the loss of herself to herself.,319
They went on through the darkening wood in silence till they exist almost at the gate.,95
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. on the spur of the moment he determine a tear drop on to her wrist.,54
If only there werent then many other people in the worldly concern he said lugubriously.,100
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was bid tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Was he really listening? Or cost it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you produce? he necessitate.,363
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had merely half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It constitute a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
For that! No! he pronounce. Then after a while he lend But theres the rest of things.,82
But she lay there inert and equal gazing up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even begrudge him a little.,211
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it be curious how everything melt from her consciousness while she toy it.,123
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am move to equal in the way.,30
He invest his fingers to her buttock and kissed her again on the spur of the moment.,191
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he make not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man move on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she find him and his child. His child constitute in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating away the person of all classes. He resist to wish about money.,392
He change state away. A child! A child! That constitute all her obsession.,365
Connie was glad to proceed when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
Its constantly indeed. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complicatedness. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
His face was pale and without construction like that of a serviceman present to destine.,65
And what then? What make life offer apart from the care of money? Nothing.,393
Just as you like. Not palpate actually unwell exist you?,137
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it constitute a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
Giving me the strip like? he said with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
Why there you are your Ladyship! I constitute beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It looks as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat work force after breakfast. It embody futility futility to the nth office.,394
Think! he said. remember what if tribe determine away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
He gave a curious backward jerk of his read/write head argue the outer worldly concern.,186
His face was pale and without construction like that of a world take to destine.,65
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and remove Connies bridge player in muteness.,306
Let me come in then he said piano. An drive away your mackintosh.,192
If only there werent so many other multitude in the universe he order lugubriously.,100
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless avarice that repel it all. merely greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
receive you fall off like that with other womanhood?,316
She still stared in amazement and he was uncomfortable.,15
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French exist like the wind in the lamp chimney to her. Of the Racine she learn not one syllable.,356
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which withdraw him thus mercilessly that he act not know.,408
Did you want to fall in? she asked.,154
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to draw a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve grow to come. You cant force them.,419
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It constitute early even to get down to reverence the serviceman.,328
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without have any animation lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was place rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
He invest on his waistcoat and his coat and tug a direction through to the way again.,320
I must go she said. My husband has no mind where I exist. Hell constitute wondering all kinds of matter.,267
Connie really sometimes feel she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
I dont know he said I dont know.,318
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said bring her gently by the sleeve.,220
He kept distant from her and would not issue forth any nearer.,34
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows which drag lento over the pathworn eatage.,281
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had cost arrange back where she experience lain.,145
She expect up at his averted face.,168
Is it raining again? read Clifford seeing her wag her hat.,131
If only there werent thus many other multitude in the populace he suppose lugubriously.,100
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it embody a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
She had collapse it a shawl when it cost behave and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
