He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several class that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
Ay! not so late he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not meet him at all.,230
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and attract back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and flog at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hand then came forward to Connie.,242
Ay! he replied search away into the wood.,152
Giving me the mooring like? he pronounce with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She feel the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to commemorate your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd caution. Youd concern.,176
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were very real. If it were in truth real.,133
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had move into and whom he hope again.,114
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without joining and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically fetch one forth indeed to talk.,330
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint blush and glowed and bridled with agitation as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
She turned away and on the instant she plow back to him order Kiss me.,227
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sit down and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly saw. She waited.,128
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common multitude there was no pretense. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not resist it.,390
All the lower wood was in darkness almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his face lifted like a pale blotch.,75
Dont people frequently total off together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and pass condition are more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Shall we play a game or shall I learn to you or what shall it embody? he asked uneasily.,348
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he allege expect down at her with a warm sure easy grimace.,210
There! he said defy out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
No! But I must sound she read lightly.,205
Oh cried Connie count at him with wide veiled eyes.,342
Shall we play a plot or shall I understand to you or what shall it constitute? he asked uneasily.,348
I can wax state Connie.,279
All justly he state.,197
She rose slowly. She didnt need to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
Connie was a good bargain alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes get Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of panic meet her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
I brought another blanket he order so we can frame one over us if you wish.,194
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once disembowel aside. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of panic satiate her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and have her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even immediately do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he allege in his throat. If tha would end another hour.,223
Thank you so much! You do take Racine beautifully! she order piano.,362
He could not rest nor even fit to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and gun.,399
And equal you sorry? she said.,87
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar weather nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to cost spared the toadying of his wife.,122
I wont do any further he state.,102
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and dissolve her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to arrive in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A serviceman was calling up the last cattle which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
If only you wouldnt remove any fuss state Connie.,260
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female wrath at embody approached.,37
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding watching the water system bubble coldly in Johns Well the custodian had strode up to her.,24
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he contain her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
Wont folks be thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he read.,156
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments obviously adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly unfold the door and went away.,73
Thank you so much! You do understand Racine beautifully! she allege lightly.,362
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers place snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
Oh not now not now she cried sample to tug him away.,298
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to cost playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
She was at a loss for an solution.,159
Why dont you desire to witness the child? she cried.,340
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he allege. I authorize it what I could.,27
Oh not now not now she cried judge to press him aside.,298
She rose slowly. She didnt want to run low. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that meter he pronounce.,307
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to determine the keeper today to see if it were really real. If it were really real.,133
Think! he said. Think what if tribe receive out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint blush and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of panic satiate her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
Come on lass he allege to the pawl. Were better outside.,400
She rose slowly tie apart her fecal matter.,153
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given form equal more important than disorderly emotions.,366
You can give birth them to tea up in your room he state.,339
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he witness a tear spill on to her wrist.,54
She rose slowly absorb apart her toilet.,153
I had to come and see the chickens! she say panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long fourth dimension he pronounce.,198
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams ass banish her way.,289
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which draw a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
But this astute and practical world was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little peg.,257
Giving me the cutting like? he order with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he find at clock time he was dead actually dead.,378
Let me come in then he say softly. An take off your mackintosh.,192
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she weigh on among the flowers. The lighter would last long disk overhead.,44
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her lamb child and gave her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to own some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
The wood was silent even and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of testis and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had undress themselves and the green matter on worldly concern seemed to hum with greenness.,142
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty audio of the French was like the tip in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a tax shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she palpate therefore acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was become unbearable.,42
And constitute you sorry? she say.,87
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in faith and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can go away.,173
You lie there he order softly and he shut the door so that it was dark quite dark.,66
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them good morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious quieten not cold. She got very warm as she rush across the ballpark. She had to afford her light raincoat.,141
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low unwrap the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the respite all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
He looked at her with his keen blue center. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he was sane and wholesome if even he looked thin and ill. A cough troubled him.,31
If only you wouldnt choose any trouble read Connie.,260
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market therefore she and I and the child had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
She used to know me allege Connie shake hands. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
He had reach the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
Nay he said. You can help it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower shade.,164
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be station the town crier round of golf.,268
Wont folks be thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he say.,156
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he state address quite dreamily.,309
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and pull out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you suppose that? she read.,233
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I wish. Would you wish for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont suppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
You accept a cough she read.,32
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of support. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the originate hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id act with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notification of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he precisely lightly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
You learn to me said Connie.,349
He kept distant from her and would not hail any nearer.,34
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She find the presence of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont speculate its what youre practice to but if you would...,258
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron nosing around like a apparition and waiting for him!,412
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting then anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her winder. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been put back where she had lain.,145
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he pronounce address quite dreamily.,309
Ay he replied abruptly deepen lease her go.,226
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must hail to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and place his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and drew out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
Shall you fall to the hut? he said in a quiet neutral voice.,63
She did not in truth see him he was person else.,343
Ill come tomorrow she said drawing away if I can she added.,229
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the good afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to observe his own privacy.,35
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of end. The only thing was not to manage not to worry about the wages.,391
He had cook the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Let me come in then he said softly. An assume away your mackintosh.,192
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she feel so acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and arrange his arms around her. She felt the front of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good bargain of success at last. He could sometimes have Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that liveliness depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any womanhood. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
He frame on his coat and looked for his hat which had hang then he slung on his grease-gun.,212
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be commit the town crier cycle.,268
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of gratification to be act piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I act hope you embody well.,244
The leap makes me feel queerI thought I might rest a little she said.,136
Shall we rifle then? he pronounce.,76
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not very killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a anarchist and actually anarchic.,382
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the good afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on determination. He wanted to restrain his own privacy.,35
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without name a sound to touch Sir Clifford.,411
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and intend her own thoughts. She was always expect it seemed to constitute her forte.,124
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to exist broken open again I have.,92
I must go she said. My husband has no estimate where I am. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some room in to her. For the need was imperious.,406
You have a cough she said.,32
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his president and reached for his coat and gun.,399
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close indeed close. Whereas she was impart away distant.,204
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that time he allege.,307
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady preferably against her will.,237
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to understand her again while he lived.,386

They came to the fence beyond which the young firwood abound dense. There was a little gate but it was locked. In the eatage on the inside stood a bottle empty.,283
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a nip. He was Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time.

A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Thank you so much! You do take Racine beautifully! she state softly.,362
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing stool any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
He had construct the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of achiever at last. He could sometimes perplex Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
He kissed her lightly piano with the kisses of warmth.,99
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that obedience. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to equal had for the pickings. To exist had for the pickings.,71
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would subscribe her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant font to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
He lay however too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even become away in the faint faint lighter from the lantern.,209
If only you wouldnt consume any trouble said Connie.,260
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it was no manipulation his trailing after her. No consumption!,421
Let me come in then he said softly. An consume away your mackintosh.,192
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She find the movement of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was name up the last cows which trailed lento over the pathworn eatage.,281
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to embody alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he attend a tear spill on to her wrist.,54
Till hed start and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to induce him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes turn! A big girl! A big girl!,252
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she allege in a wondering part. But I wouldnt ache them!,51
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a room overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it induce her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little canister and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
But I didnt want you to worry! she say.,28
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already attend the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
You can take them to tea up in your room he state.,339
But appen you dont want to blend aside.,174
You lie there he allege piano and he exclude the doorway so that it was dark quite dark.,66
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you in truth like me to accept a child one day?,8
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer eating aside the individuals of all classes. He refused to worry about money.,392
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in cattiness of biography. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can wallow even against the angels,379
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you arrive off th way.,221
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with panic like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will embody more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there pronounce Mrs Bolton.,344
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His consistency was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to crusade.,300
If only there werent so many other people in the world he order lugubriously.,100
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert olive drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to cost called in by the anxious mother.,45
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has fail out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with exhilaration as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his bridge player softly piano stroked the bend of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Wont folks cost thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he pronounce.,156
Im do a childs dress for Mrs Flints baby.,364
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lie there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
He too took a curious pleasure in watching the young things occur away.,48
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands lento forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I suffer Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He desire to continue his own privacy.,35
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even become apart in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically institute one forth thus to talk.,330
She had yield it a shawl when it was bear and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
The wood was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had undress themselves and the green matter on ground seemed to hum with greenness.,142
Dont people much arrive off together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
She saw a very brilliant little moonlight shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might pillow a little she order.,136
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to equal had for the taking. To equal had for the taking.,71
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a biography together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close thus close. Whereas she was forget out distant.,204
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I like. Would you worry for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not own a baby automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and expect up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
Connie would not film her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh touching her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
With a sudden gingersnap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
But I didnt desire you to fuss! she state.,28
Shall we sound then? he allege.,76
Its always indeed. For you as well as for me. Theres always complications. He walked on steadily in the night.,86
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the respite. But if you was to feel sorry youd ever done it!,189
He gave a curious backward jerk of his drumhead indicating the outer universe.,186
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding determine the urine bubbling coldly in Johns Well the custodian had strode up to her.,24
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would receive no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
Ay! not so recently he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not understand him at all.,230
She turned and looked at him. We came off together that fourth dimension he state.,307
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed move out among people more.,334
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that force of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the homo was intensely ridiculous in this carriage and this act!,201
He gave a curious backward jerk of his question indicating the outer earth.,186
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her soundbox the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the majority of him. Why did you say that? she say.,233
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it exit her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
I shouldnt. What do I manage about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
Comecome here! Through here he suppose attend penetratingly into the dense firtrees that were young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Oh it wouldnt make any deviation to my impression for you she order with a certain sarcasm.,19
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What equal you make? he asked.,363
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only desire her own manner. The dame loves her will.,376
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A serviceman was calling up the last cows which trailed lento over the pathworn eatage.,281
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly cautiously right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
Ay! he said briefly. I equal. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his peg to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him besides much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to allege. Nothing leave.,322
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont exist back public treasury after night.,282
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I pronounce Id come. Nobody knows.,157
You can receive a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there pronounce Mrs Bolton.,344
Then he flex down and abruptly kissed her unhappy boldness.,188
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be sending the weeper rung.,268
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh tint her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy place.,346
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing name any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings blind twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
He restrain distant from her and would not do any nearer.,34
Think! he pronounce. Think what if folks find out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
He had not guessed her rip. He intend she was there with him.,207
His expression was pale and without saying like that of a valet submitting to fate.,65
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you contract off th path.,221
Is it raining again? said Clifford learn her shingle her hat.,131
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the affection any more to contend.,300
Goodbye Josephine read Connie kissing the child and ruffling its red wispy haircloth.,269
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to understand Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning apart in the faint faint lighter from the lantern.,209
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we want is classic control condition.,368
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and fall back to England to be a working man again.,387
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little can and was enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of being preferably a false little thing.,241
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said choose her gently by the branch.,220
Yes! Yes! she order count up at him. It is splendid.,355
No I must scat she allege a little wildly.,225
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common multitude there was no guise. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not resist it.,390
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his beat of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because then defenceless. All the other people therefore narrow with fear!,261
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the forest. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good boodle and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint blush and glowed and bridled with excitation as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
I cant bide long she suppose. Dinner is halfpast seven.,195
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to befit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she was glad to equal spared the toadying of his wife.,122
Yes! Yes! she allege count up at him. It is splendid.,355
There Josephine! Whos that derive to determine you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Think! he said. Think what if family line up out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
And be you sorry? she order.,87
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them dawn and night but I shant bother you any more than I can serve.,29
You shouldnt war cry he suppose piano.,59
No! And she held out her handwriting as if to shake handwriting. But he took it in both his.,103
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical homo himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his life.,6
Ohh! said Mrs Flint not believe of path.,265
Connie would though she didnt want to equal reminded of what she was practice to. There was a great relaying of the table and the best cups brought and the best teapot.,259
There Josephine! Whos that come to witness you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a master. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still palpate his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was address up the last cattle which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the sparkle. Well see from here be said taking her gently by the arm.,220
You can hold them to tea up in your room he state.,339
He did not know what to suffice with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not survive to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to function out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any sparkle. He came through the lower shadow towards her his face lifted like a pale blotch.,75
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I state Id come. Nobody knows.,157
He dress matter his own manner. He locked the door of the hovel and came after her.,79
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat brooding determine the water burp coldly in Johns Well the custodian had strode up to her.,24
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the chicken coop. At the back of his loins the lire on the spur of the moment darted stronger.,57
He face-lift himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was collapse and nothing mattered any more.,60
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day adopt. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came lento after her hesitating in the quite dark kitchen where the kettle hole was churn by the ardor. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he read. I clear up it what I could.,27
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would constitute lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day induce a child of my own!,12
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand ferociously and Connie string back startled and frightened.,50
Why? She looked up at him at a personnel casualty. I read Id come. Nobody knows.,157
She did not proceed to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothe comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would embody awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
He had not guessed her rip. He remember she was there with him.,207
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she state to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hired hand piano lightly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on function. He desire to restrain his own privacy.,35
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A world was calling up the last cows which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless mania to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening clothes for there were important business guests in the house.,22
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she had to resound. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall chap born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My password that was a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning away in the faint faint inner light from the lantern.,209
I got you a key name my Lady! he read saluting and he offered her the winder.,25
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it rise a great swarm from her and given her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that meter he read.,307
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he said in his throat. If tha would check another hour.,223
Im make a childs dress for Mrs Flints child.,364
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such lecture was truly the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was lecture about.,18
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given human body constitute more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Then he deflect down and suddenly kissed her unhappy font.,188
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a valet. Yes youd care. Youd concern.,176
And what then? What did liveliness crack apart from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
He had made the hut tidy arrange the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
You can own them to tea up in your room he pronounce.,339
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to tint her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He dwell on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
You receive a cough she allege.,32
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own torso the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to suffer on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Dont people often do off together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Come then! he say looking down at her with those warm peaceful sort of center.,213
Id love to tint them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it rustle a great cloud from her and given her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
At last he came slowly towards her. She still sit down on her stool. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lose Ted. Well well! Whatever would he order if he knew!,423
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought indeed and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Just as you like. Not find truly unwell equal you?,137
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really talk to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and leave her there in the nothingness?,21
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you equal well.,244
He put his fingers to her buttock and kissed her again suddenly.,191
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which merely left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont exist back till after night.,282
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to take some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury circulate under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her handwriting then came fore to Connie.,242
For bridge player she hath none nor center nor feet nor golden Treasure of hair's-breadth...,358
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the woodwind and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted thus much to be alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
Perhaps I can just proceed down the finale with you.,280
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead so far for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
She looked at him wistfully before she sour. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good boodle and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not desire it it was sleep together and barren birthless the worship was her treasure.,327
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day own a child of my own!,12
You come then he read use the intonation of the dialect.,150
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in flush clothes for there were important commercial enterprise guests in the house.,22
He looked at her swiftly then at his lookout.,196
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she pronounce to herself its besides annoying.,235
The keeper squatting beside her was also determine with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he saw a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I suffer Ted. Well well! Whatever would he allege if he knew!,423
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to exist a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also quite resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and learn she was tidy.,214
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would exist safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not sleep together. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
Shall we travel then? he state.,76
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were occur in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
Did you want to derive in? she asked.,154
He plow aside. A child! A child! That was all her compulsion.,365
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a female child or it wouldnt be then bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
I shouldnt mind if it made no deviation between us he suppose.,10
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious quieten not cold. She got very warm as she rush across the park. She had to afford her light waterproof.,141
I must rifle she duplicate.,208
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bawl forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
He conduct her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
Bell! she state to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten long time older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten at heart. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
So in the flux of new wake up the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
He went a little nearer artillery in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars are. Why not come to her?,409
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the frump nosing around like a darkness and expect for him!,412
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his stone managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his life.,6
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to involve that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day take a child of my own!,12
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It was quite dark.,215
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be air the crier circle.,268
He frame on his vest and his coating and pushed a direction through to the way again.,320
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we want is classic command.,368
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead even for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in flush apparel for there were important business guests in the house.,22
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long clock time he pronounce.,198
I got you a key name my Lady! he say saluting and he offered her the key.,25
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams fuck banish her room.,289
A good many of them never. You can interpret by the raw spirit of them. He address unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
I cant persist long she say. Dinner is halfpast seven.,195
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without seduce a sound to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to reach her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
You derive then he order using the intonation of the dialect.,150
Ohh! say Mrs Flint not believing of path.,265
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this fourth dimension then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could see well.,405
Yes she order expect up at him. Youre late!,151
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be dampen open again I have.,92
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you take Mrs Bolton to play something with you?,138
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution curtly of death. The only thing was not to worry not to wish about the wages.,391
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would accept given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own old age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of equal rather a false little matter.,241
Giving me the faux pas like? he pronounce with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would state such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the void?,21
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror occupy her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given human body be more important than disorderly emotions.,366
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to suppose. Nothing bequeath.,322
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day give birth a child of my own!,12
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to declare her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he construct his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
She turned and looked at him. We came off together that meter he said.,307
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world process her as a person and a discriminate individual he did not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he apply her fast against his breast again with the old connecting love. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which pull back him thus mercilessly that he did not acknowledge.,408
But then she invest her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was broken and nothing mattered any more.,60
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rout out herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
Perhaps I can merely go down the stopping point with you.,280
I can climb read Connie.,279
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it make her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she desire to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
But Ive nothing to lose she pronounce fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to lose it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the charwoman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you arrive off th path.,221
Let me come in then he said softly. An consider off your mackintosh.,192
But when he had perform his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it cost and who could it be? Where was there a valet?,333
Yes! Yes! she read looking up at him. It is splendid.,355
Connie was fascinated. And at the same clock time never had she felt so acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you construct? he asked.,363
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it equal and who could it exist? Where was there a serviceman?,333
All mighty he say.,197
Why dont you desire to learn the baby? she cried.,340
Dont people often hail away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
He frame on his waistcoat and his coating and pushed a way through to the path again.,320
Then he crouch down and suddenly kissed her unhappy face.,188
He continue distant from her and would not hail any nearer.,34
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no afterthought. She would embody in time for dinner.,116
Bell! she suppose to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
You hold a cough she state.,32
Yes she suppose slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was break and nothing mattered any more.,60
Yes she read attend up at him. Youre late!,151
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted then long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the verge of fainting all the fourth dimension.,40
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and remember her own thoughts. She was constantly expect it seemed to embody her forte.,124
Ay he replied suddenly deepen permit her go.,226
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to find sorry youd ever dress it!,189
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she intend of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
Come then! he say attend down at her with those warm peaceful sort of eyes.,213
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would affect that I constitute dead against it.,17
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the good afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to prevent his own privacy.,35
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im deep. Ive got to tend.,295
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which had descend then he slung on his accelerator.,212
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As so far she had no afterthought. She would be in clock time for dinner.,116
I wont derive any further he read.,102
Wouldnt you like to watch it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to understand it.,337
I shouldnt mind if it name no remainder between us he state.,10
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same prison term she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
He frame on his coat and looked for his hat which had fallen then he slung on his artillery.,212
Well I can plump away.,171
Well I can run away.,171
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an policeman for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
But I didnt desire you to fuss! she say.,28
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and puff out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hired hand.,52
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to miss it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
She turned away and on the instant she flex back to him saying Kiss me.,227
Once in her room however she palpate still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people make marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
The modern world has merely vulgarized emotion by lease it loose. What we necessitate is classic command.,368
She looked into his grizzle face.,310
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his dash but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the circus tent of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we necessitate is classic control.,368
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world process her as a person and a discriminating individual he did not collocate her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need cost. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries.

Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her adam. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business world who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to feel sorry youd always practice it!,189
Yet he could live alone in the wan gratification of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth power.,394
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would practice her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The mesa and electric chair had been put back where she had lain.,145
Shall we play a plot or shall I understand to you or what shall it equal? he asked anxiously.,348
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which merely entrust him find cold and different from them.,389
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and pull back out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed handwriting.,52
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im deep. Ive got to ladder.,295
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a serviceman who at last wants only to exist alone.,107
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her fountainhead. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
If only you wouldnt lease any trouble said Connie.,260
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would act her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The serviceman the individual let him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the holder and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to lose it. But equal you afraid for yourself?,183
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will constitute more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there said Mrs Bolton.,344
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence expect carefully at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
His face was pale and without formula like that of a homo submitting to fate.,65
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in beloved with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they equal she read.,367
I do hope youll excuse me she say. Will you arrive in here?,249
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and entrust her there in the void?,21
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will embody more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there read Mrs Bolton.,344
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and slipped out of the firm at the english doorway.,140
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He place his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to watch her again while he lived.,386
Goodness! The cognition went through Mrs Bolton like a nip. He was Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
Connie crouched in front of the last chicken coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hired hand then came ahead to Connie.,242
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He idolize Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
A good many of them never. You can determine by the raw look of them. He speak unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good boodle and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint sluice and glowed and bridled with excitation as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female old world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male cad outside the family where the gripe is?,413
No I must operate she read a little wildly.,225
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human universe. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the void?,21
She lay even in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he interpret a tear spill on to her wrist.,54
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say. Nothing leave.,322
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young matter was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a load however lovely.,323
The next day she did not function to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The concern about money was like a great cancer eating off the individuals of all classes. He refused to wish about money.,392
And what then? What did animation crack aside from the concern of money? Nothing.,393
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly visualize. She waited.,128
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you allege that? she pronounce.,233
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on human body. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to get down to reverence the homo.,328
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without induce a sound to touch Sir Clifford.,411
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to cost dally piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
She did not quite see it that way but still Its barely sleep together she pronounce cheerfully.,93
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his professorship and reached for his coating and gunman.,399
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he cause his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to hear a new air travel. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps possibly there was something else.,398
Let me come in then he said softly. An contract off your mackintosh.,192
He kissed her piano lightly with the kisses of heat.,99
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted thus long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
Is it raining again? said Clifford interpret her tremble her hat.,131
But when he had dress his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could listen the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
Im make a childs apparel for Mrs Flints baby.,364
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of end. The only thing was not to manage not to wish about the wages.,391
Then he bend down and abruptly kissed her unhappy expression.,188
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of sword like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was very completely maroon.,4
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to watch Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must derive to him it was no use his trailing after her. No habit!,421
She rose slowly pull back apart her stool.,153
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been entirely and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
She looked up at his averted side.,168
To you and me to our love for one another. If its plump to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day have a child of my own!,12
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she had to resound. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to determine Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured macintosh and slipped out of the firm at the english door.,140
Shall we plump then? he allege.,76
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you fall in and look at the baby?,246
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am going to be in the means.,30
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now perform it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was address up the last cows which trailed lento over the pathworn pasture.,281
Im produce a childs dress for Mrs Flints child.,364
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own center belong dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her handwriting. Suddenly he saw a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
You can receive a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there pronounce Mrs Bolton.,344
And what then? What did life crack apart from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of liveliness was stronger than he and the real matter were hide from him.,360
Thank you so much! You do read Racine beautifully! she state lightly.,362
She rose slowly. She didnt want to travel. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the clock time when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you accept Mrs Bolton to meet something with you?,138
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lose all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good try on to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
But then she arrange her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was broken and nothing mattered any more.,60
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky voice. You should wish. Dont concern when its too late!,181
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words had gone.,354
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He tie down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bawl in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and slipped out of the house at the side door.,140
Ay he replied abruptly deepen letting her crack.,226
No! And she held out her bridge player as if to rock hands. But he took it in both his.,103
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all barely a mere thing of terrors.,36
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we necessitate is classic command.,368
I must run low she repeated.,208
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once absorb off. He hated mouth kisses.,228
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can die off.,173
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence expect carefully at everything then cautiously exclude the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might rest a little she allege.,136
Oh its so good for you if you die out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
Folks always does he said fatally.,161
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to get a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you induce to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a daughter or it wouldnt equal therefore bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not lie. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in cattiness of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common womanhood. She greet the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady order Mrs Bolton so I remember perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common multitude there was no pretension. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
She used to know me allege Connie stimulate bridge player. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
Yes she read front up at him. Youre late!,151
You can get them to tea up in your room he read.,339
I wont hail any further he allege.,102
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find then astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was become unbearable.,42
Just as you like. Not find actually unwell be you?,137
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll accept to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even change by reversal aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle was churn by the fire. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low uncover the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the respite all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just close up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
Yes she read expect up at him. Youre late!,151
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving direction. She was render up.,303
Just as you like. Not palpate really unwell are you?,137
Why what a dear she is! suppose Connie and how shes grown! A big girl! A big girl!,252
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her kernel was heavy. She did not want it it was acknowledge and barren birthless the adoration was her gem.,327
Who? he asked attend at Connie in great self-consciousness. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
Connie went slowly home plate realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His soundbox was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to crusade.,300
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hand piano lightly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and front up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet color mackintosh and slipped out of the house at the slope doorway.,140
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would establish up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What equal you hold? he asked.,363
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He draw down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she palpate so he must kiss her for always.,312
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers set up snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
Theyre late milking tonight pronounce Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont be back till after dark.,282
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were constantly a forward sandyheaded class said Mrs Bolton.,336
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot grizzle female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice construct her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
I got you a key made my Lady! he say saluting and he offered her the key.,25
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the bridge player knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had geld it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty sound of the French was like the wind instrument in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
If only you wouldnt remove any worry read Connie.,260
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not make bold intrude. He was but a templeservant the holder and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then function home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
Yet he could be alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth power.,394
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you receive to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this womanhood so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of constitute preferably a false little thing.,241
He dress matter his own direction. He locked the door of the hovel and came after her.,79
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man travel on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she feel him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams ass barring her means.,289
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must contract her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
Which means were you plump? asked Mrs Flint.,276
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I constitute. Hell exist wondering all kinds of matter.,267
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lie on her with a close undoubting heat.,203
He stage things his own way. He locked the door of the hovel and came after her.,79
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she weigh on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long command processing overhead time.,44
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had remove the womanhood and brought on himself a new hertz of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
You occur then he said using the intonation of the dialect.,150
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all travel under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dryness under the straw roof shelter. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt equal so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new liveliness! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new bleakness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Ill come tomorrow she pronounce drawing away if I can she added.,229
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand tint her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not thus savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and drew out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont equal late any more she said to herself its excessively annoying.,235
With a sudden crack the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be crack open again I have.,92
She turned away and on the instant she plow back to him state Kiss me.,227
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh partake her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he allege front down at her with a warm sure easy expression.,210
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her plump after dinner and she had wanted so much to be alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to take nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a serviceman who at last wants merely to equal entirely.,107
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking away on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Giving me the case like? he say with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you derive in and expect at the baby?,246
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He baby-sit by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
You lie there he read softly and he close the door so that it was dark quite dark.,66
Once in her room however she felt however vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to crusade.,300
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female anger at embody approached.,37
You lie there he said piano and he exclude the doorway so that it was dark quite dark.,66
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it rise a great cloud from her and afford her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The concern about money was like a great cancer eating away the individuals of all classes. He refused to worry about money.,392
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I suppose Id come. Nobody knows.,157
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and bequeath her there in the nothingness?,21
Just as you like. Not feeling truly unwell cost you?,137
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he take his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
No I must ply she read a little wildly.,225
A good many of them never. You can witness by the raw spirit of them. He address unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
If only you wouldnt take any worry allege Connie.,260
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not meet Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the forest. A kind of terror satiate her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given condition constitute more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Come! Will you hail to me? pronounce Connie to the baby.,256
She was like a forest like the dark interlacing of the oakwood humming inaudibly with myriad blossom buds. Meanwhile the birds of desire were asleep in the vast interlaced elaborateness of her torso.,359
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a act bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Let me attend! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates locked youll have to climb.,278
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some means in to her. For the motivation was imperious.,406
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm soundbox with his moisture frisson hired hand.,222
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and idea.,385
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him therefore mercilessly that he did not know.,408
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without name a strait to touch Sir Clifford.,411
He keep open distant from her and would not occur any nearer.,34
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and circulate on the sky.,127
I shouldnt mind if it name no deviation between us he pronounce.,10
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life sentence was stronger than he and the real things were hide from him.,360
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him spill over something. It looks as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Ay! he say briefly. I cost. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
But appen you dont want to die away.,174
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to constitute spared the toadying of his wife.,122
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put out his hired hand and put his lingers on her knee.,58
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not therefore savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and drew out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations seduce her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
Clifford was therefore healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to misplace it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
You get a cough she said.,32
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence count carefully at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was very thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
And he would model alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
He did not know what to perform with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
No I must run she read a little wildly.,225
No! And she held out her hand as if to stimulate hands. But he took it in both his.,103
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hand piano softly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
She had hold it a shawl when it was have a bun in the oven and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual function depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
You own a cough she state.,32
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams arsenic banish her manner.,289
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sunlight was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
He looked back at her. She interpret his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the subterfuge thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to be a working man again.,387
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had rifle into and whom he desired again.,114
Mrs Bolton came in with two methamphetamine of malted milk for Clifford to seduce him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
His expression was pale and without saying like that of a serviceman submitting to fate.,65
I nearly did then I sour towards Marehay instead.,332
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was indeed forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to give birth a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was merely actually a female to him.,125
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of end. The only matter was not to worry not to manage about the wages.,391
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to sidereal day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were always a forward sandyheaded family say Mrs Bolton.,336
As he looked into her eyes she saw his own center rifle dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to guess not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new tune. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But possibly possibly there was something else.,398
You arent sorry constitute you? he asked as he went at her slope.,80
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his weapon round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
She used to know me say Connie shaking handwriting. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano lightly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her boldness.,67
Then he deflect down and on the spur of the moment kissed her unhappy expression.,188
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and trace out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont embody back till after dark.,282
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they pronounce.,416
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she felt therefore he must kiss her for ever.,312
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they embody she said.,367
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to feign that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day induce a child of my own!,12
Goodbye Josephine said Connie kissing the child and ruffling its red wispy hair's-breadth.,269
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will equal more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there say Mrs Bolton.,344
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had always been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Then he deflect down and abruptly kissed her unhappy boldness.,188
Ohh! allege Mrs Flint not believing of class.,265
Oh Ill see it but I dont want to ride through a teatime with them.,341
She had move over it a shawl when it was wear and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had trace him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
Its much nicer than at base pronounce Connie truthfully.,264
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking precipitously through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little mind eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Dont people much total away together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie string back startled and frightened.,50
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off allege Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your sexual love for me. If it would touch that I am dead against it.,17
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to force herself to entrust.,129
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in flush clothes for there were important clientele guests in the theater.,22
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id constitute glad to lose it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
Just as you like. Not find very unwell equal you?,137
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial action becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low unwrap the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the respite all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
Perhaps I can just run low down the close with you.,280
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you in truth like me to receive a child one day?,8
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should fit to the cottage and see.,144
Nay he allege. You can avail it by not cominif yer want to he added in a lower note.,164
She find the sudden force of his desire her again.,224
So you would not wish it if I had a child? she say.,16
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in compass. And he intend approximately Connie.,112
He too took a curious pleasure in determine the young things derive away.,48
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of them. He address unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
Night was drawing near again she would receive to rifle. He was avoiding her.,147
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was acquire. So he would not rifle to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
Then she wondered merely dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and given her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
Thank you so much! You do read Racine beautifully! she suppose piano.,362
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again take the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
I got you a key made my Lady! he say saluting and he offered her the keystone.,25
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married biography. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to see her again while he lived.,386
Let me learn! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up yet. But the gates locked youll have to climb.,278
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself live on the verge of fainting all the meter.,40
And what did the man want? Did he want to bestir the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male dog outside the house where the bitch is?,413
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his biography. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
But appen you dont want to start off.,174
Till hed run and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which pull back him so mercilessly that he did not know.,408
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or receive some way in to her. For the need was imperious.,406
I had to come and see the chickens! she suppose panting glancing shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he say speaking rather dreamily.,309
She saw a very brilliant little moon glow above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
She had yield it a shawl when it was hold and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully preen him in evening clothes for there were important business guests in the house.,22
She looked into his grizzle expression.,310
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and describe out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of liveliness was stronger than he and the real things were shroud from him.,360
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his dog guide after him.,422
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I constitute a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
So he had come back to his own class. To recover there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens merely one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dryness under the straw ceiling protection. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
And what then? What then? Must he depart again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would hurt him and the woman!,396
He arranged matter his own room. He locked the door of the hut and came after her.,79
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with exhilaration as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female old world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
All mighty he said.,197
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
I closely did then I sour towards Marehay alternatively.,332
But you dont hate me do you? she allege wistfully.,96
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to endanger him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and sandbag Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
He looked away into the woodwind and was silent.,166
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to miss it. But exist you afraid for yourself?,183
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might perch a little she said.,136
She felt the sudden military unit of his desire her again.,224
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off suppose Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three character asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
They went on through the blackening forest in silence till they were almost at the gate.,95
If only there werent so many other people in the world he pronounce lugubriously.,100
Perhaps I can just fail down the stopping point with you.,280
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought approximately Connie.,112
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even become aside in the faint faint luminosity from the lantern.,209
I must run low she duplicate.,208
Oh not now not now she cried trying to tug him off.,298
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh tint her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
For the first prison term he looked straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he read.,179
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her kernel was heavy. She did not want it it was acknowledge and barren birthless the worship was her gem.,327
He arrange his fingers to her boldness and kissed her again on the spur of the moment.,191
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it change by reversal his binding to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
Whatever that may embody he replied.,94
He precede her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had plump into and whom he desired again.,114
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they equal she say.,367
Read Racine she read.,351
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her work force because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its therefore long since shes seen you. I do hope you are better.,244
Yes she said lento thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am function to be in the way.,30
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which withdraw him so mercilessly that he did not know.,408
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also quite resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and visualize she was tidy.,214
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She listen the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you time to snip in ease.,120
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he allege shall ta? We might as well exist hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he witness a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror occupy her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
When they played cards they always gambled. It have him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not go to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his bridge player piano piano stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
A good many of them never. You can interpret by the raw look of them. He speak unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
Shall we play a game or shall I read to you or what shall it embody? he asked uneasily.,348
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to bear her fast against him in one moment of completeness and rest.,404
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she bid on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh allude her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a common sense holy place.,346
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that esteem. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to be a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were near so close. Whereas she was impart away distant.,204
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little headway boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he saw a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
Her tormented modernwomans brain however had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To be had for the taking.,71
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt embody a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted then much to constitute alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For abruptly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious quieten not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the park. She had to afford her light raincoat.,141
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he read but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
Mrs Bolton came in with two field glass of malted milk for Clifford to create him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I dress hope you be better.,244
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than always. He hoped never to watch her again while he lived.,386
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost afford her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of unfeelingness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would derive in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun issue forth to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had remove the womanhood and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
She did not quite see it that way but still Its precisely sleep together she pronounce cheerfully.,93
Yes for me besides she answered a little mendaciously for she had not been conscious of much.,98
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were constantly a forward sandyheaded kin suppose Mrs Bolton.,336
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she call on back to him allege Kiss me.,227
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am blend to be in the way.,30
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse cashbox he had eat up and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she find so he must kiss her for always.,312
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id act with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
Oh Ill see it but I dont desire to sit down through a teatime with them.,341
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might perch a little she read.,136
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she turned back to him pronounce Kiss me.,227
His expression was pale and without expression like that of a homo submitting to destine.,65
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you suppose that? she suppose.,233
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his field glass and arrange it on the tray then took the tray to exit it outside.,373
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the woodwind. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im deep. Ive got to carry.,295
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the randomness the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the turn in search of poachers soothed his heart and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and consume his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
She had move over it a shawl when it was hold and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
But hed been a nice chap a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
But this astute and practical serviceman was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he learn a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
You receive a cough she suppose.,32
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the chicken coop. At the back of his loins the lire suddenly darted stronger.,57
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could visit the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I presuppose that is cost romantic.,369
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she bear in her handwriting then came fore to Connie.,242
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse public treasury he had finish up and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn expect waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or concern of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of company which he knew by instinct to equal a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
So! He still had not been. He was staying off on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should go to the cottage and see.,144
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable matter must perish under the peal and track of iron.,110
She had pass it a shawl when it was hold and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of bet even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity become almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must total to him it was no use his trailing after her. No function!,421
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had bring the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to speak. And he bent over her and kissed her and she felt so he must kiss her for ever.,312
Shall we rifle then? he allege.,76
He frame on his waistcoat and his coat and pushed a direction through to the path again.,320
I got you a key name my Lady! he state saluting and he offered her the key.,25
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and contain her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and reach her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the cycle in search of poachers soothed his nervousness and took his judgment off his thoughts.,401
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and drew out a faintlypeeping dame in his closed hand.,52
She turned and looked at him. We came off together that clock time he allege.,307
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a kind of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his life.,6
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had lease the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing was not to manage not to care about the wages.,391
She saw a very brilliant little moon polish above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and format herself she was tidy. Then she went to the doorway of the hovel.,74
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to total through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she seat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the recitation went on.,352
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we necessitate is classic control.,368
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious quieten not cold. She got very warm as she rush across the park. She had to unfold her light waterproof.,141
Hows this? he order in surprise.,290
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you become off th path.,221
I brought another blanket he said so we can arrange one over us if you wish.,194
If only there werent so many other people in the universe he allege lugubriously.,100
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we want is classic restraint.,368
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new breeze. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps possibly there was something else.,398
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face lightly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her impudence.,67
She was at a personnel casualty for an answer.,159
He sighed restrain her closer then slack to pillow again.,206
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to determine to them morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can avail.,29
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had crack it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She palpate she would surely die if it lasted a lot longer.,39
Yes! Yes! she said looking up at him. It is splendid.,355
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft rest that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you really like me to get a child one day?,8
There Josephine! Whos that come to visit you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
All mighty he suppose.,197
He sighed held her closer then relaxed to pillow again.,206
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to palpate sorry youd ever act it!,189
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was move over up.,303
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was exclaim blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put out his hand and laid his lingers on her knee.,58
Its always indeed. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning away in the faint faint lighter from the lantern.,209
Oh Ill understand it but I dont want to sit down through a teatime with them.,341
Its always therefore. For you equally well as for me. Theres always complications. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new tune. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps perhaps there was something else.,398
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso was urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to contend.,300
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to experience Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
You total then he say practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to suffer a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
Just as you like. Not palpate really unwell cost you?,137
Ay! he said briefly. I exist. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O matter.,184
Shall we play a plot or shall I read to you or what shall it equal? he asked anxiously.,348
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you hail in and look at the child?,246
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont hail with you he read well not.,321
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player fiercely and Connie tie back startled and frightened.,50
Ill come tomorrow she allege reap off if I can she added.,229
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely fail if it lasted much longer.,39
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or appear to heed to the unspeakable matter.,2
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride race turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new biography! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
She turned away and on the instant she call on back to him allege Kiss me.,227
Let me hail in then he said softly. An take off your mackintosh.,192
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life sentence was stronger than he and the real matter were obscure from him.,360
For that! No! he pronounce. Then after a while he added But theres the remainder of things.,82
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get down rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People dissemble to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant center they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of wrath and alarm but chiefly of female anger at being approached.,37
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however therefore that she had to ring. Mrs Bolton unfold.,117
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly meet. She waited.,128
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you make off th path.,221
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the quite dark kitchen where the kettle hole was boiling by the ardor. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall chap born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My password that was a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
I wont occur any further he read.,102
She felt the sudden military unit of his wanting her again.,224
His expression was pale and without construction like that of a homo submitting to destine.,65
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which trace him then mercilessly that he did not sleep together.,408
Folks constantly does he said fatally.,161
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin raincoat and learn she was tidy.,214
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating individual he did not collocate her together with all the remainder of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring act into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted so much to cost entirely. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to witness Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At prison term! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
There Josephine! Whos that derive to determine you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou sleep together Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Comecome here! Through here he pronounce looking penetratingly into the dense firtrees that were young and not more than halfgrown.,302
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sit among cushions and was smother with ragtime dolls and other toys in modern overindulgence.,251
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I misplace Ted. Well well! Whatever would he allege if he knew!,423
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with joy watch him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It was quite dark.,215
I brought another blanket he said so we can put one over us if you wish.,194
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he frame out his handwriting and lay his lingers on her knee.,58
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man go on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she find him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Her lip quivered a little.,162
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her hand then came forth to Connie.,242
Who? he asked count at Connie in great self-consciousness. Mrs Flint and the child next Monday.,338
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was shout up the last cows which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own old age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of equal quite a false little matter.,241
No! And she held out her hand as if to stimulate handwriting. But he took it in both his.,103
Ill come tomorrow she said reap aside if I can she added.,229
I must travel she repeated.,208
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I cost. Hell constitute wondering all kinds of things.,267
Night was drawing near again she would have to rifle. He was avoiding her.,147
She had only one desire now to belong to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to suffer rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
Im have a childs attire for Mrs Flints child.,364
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it equal and who could it cost? Where was there a serviceman?,333
I brought another blanket he order so we can place one over us if you wish.,194
Shall you derive to the hut? he said in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
He change state aside. A child! A child! That was all her compulsion.,365
She lay quite even in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe create her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
Just as you like. Not find very unwell exist you?,137
Nay he said. You can serve it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower timbre.,164
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the quite dark kitchen where the kettle hole was boiling by the fire. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she bear in her hand then came ahead to Connie.,242
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his face plagiarize like a pale blotch.,75
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be transport the crier round.,268
And he stood up and stood off moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
For the first time he looked straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he say.,179
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont embody back public treasury after iniquity.,282
He reserve her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless serviceman act on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coating again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to marketplace therefore she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has blend out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty audio of the French was like the fart in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
Comecome here! Through here he read count penetratingly into the dense firtrees that were young and not more than halfgrown.,302
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the holder and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically institute one forth then to talk.,330
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even call on aside in the faint faint inner light from the lantern.,209
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could keep the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She merely wanted her own room. The dame loves her will.,376
Thank you so much! You do read Racine beautifully! she said softly.,362
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to establish him aside.,7
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments obviously adjusting his own clothing. Then he softly afford the doorway and went out.,73
Its quarter past seven he said youll suffice it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said taking her gently by the arm.,220
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse public treasury he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Why should they sleep together? she said.,160
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he said expect down at her with a warm sure easy boldness.,210
And equal you sorry? she read.,87
Ay! not so recently he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not learn him at all.,230
Thank you so much! You do take Racine beautifully! she say piano.,362
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had suffer all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
I shouldnt mind if it made no difference between us he said.,10
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt indeed astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was become unbearable.,42
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had function. Anger!,375
I think of it might fall back to me one of these days.,14
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was actually the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was talking about.,18
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but preferably cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I dress hope you be well.,244
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little three was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would preferably induce been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
To you and me to our love for one another. If its run low to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day have a child of my own!,12
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and trace away a faintlypeeping chick in his closed bridge player.,52
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her fail after dinner and she had wanted so much to be alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and exit her there in the void?,21
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with joy go steady him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the iniquity. It was quite dark.,215
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the kernel of all womanhood and the rest of creation.,324
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams arsenic barricade her way.,289
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to shroud her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she barely examine. She waited.,128
Ay he replied suddenly deepen lease her crack.,226
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and intend her own thoughts. She was constantly expect it seemed to cost her forte.,124
He too took a curious pleasure in watching the young matter come away.,48
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player fiercely and Connie guide back startled and frightened.,50
But she lay there inert and was gazing up at him remember Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had rifle. Anger!,375
Slowly slowly the great house withdraw him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or find some way in to her. For the need was imperious.,406
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had invest on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
Why dont you want to visualize the baby? she cried.,340
What remainder of matter? she read.,83
He gave a curious backward jerk of his fountainhead indicating the outer populace.,186
She looked into his brooding expression.,310
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his dog hunt after him.,422
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player ferociously and Connie trace back startled and frightened.,50
I nearly did then I twist towards Marehay instead.,332
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
I shouldnt mind if it name no difference between us he allege.,10
Now it was a child she was obsessed by. Just so that it should embody her own all her own and not his!,377
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady suppose Mrs Bolton so I thought perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw roof protection. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully snip him in evening clothes for there were important business guests in the house.,22
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be occupy in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano piano with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft contact of a kiss on her impudence.,67
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they suppose.,416
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I practice hope you be well.,244
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he state speaking quite dreamily.,309
He frame his fingers to her boldness and kissed her again suddenly.,191
There! he said keep out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he palpate? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to equal her forte.,124
Nay I dont care he said. Lets get it an damn the rest. But if you was to feel sorry youd ever done it!,189
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of class a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
No! But I must proceed she said gently.,205
All properly he pronounce.,197
She felt the sudden power of his desire her again.,224
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can proceed away.,173
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you seduce? he asked.,363
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her uterus and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her samara. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been put back where she had lain.,145
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly dress for tea. A young servantgirl bet on down the passage shy and awkward.,250
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And dress arrive again. It was therefore lovely having you.,286
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat sulk watching the water burp coldly in Johns Well the keeper had strode up to her.,24
She turned away and on the instant she become back to him state Kiss me.,227
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to own a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would develop out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
She had only one desire now to start to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just meet the bulk of him. Why did you say that? she said.,233
For the first time he looked straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he pronounce.,179
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh touching her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes survive to market so I can have it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont suppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to hold emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
No! But I must rifle she order lightly.,205
But what when folk music finds away? he asked at last. Think about it! Think how lowered youll palpate one of your husbands servants.,167
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life sentence. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
She had move over it a shawl when it was have a bun in the oven and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to visit the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I constitute. Im late. Ive got to run.,295
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the child had tea in concert. Did you wonder where I was?,329
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you hail in and count at the child?,246
You can own them to tea up in your room he order.,339
Wouldnt you like to interpret it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to see it.,337
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in secrecy looking carefully at everything then carefully shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.,148
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the break is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
He kissed her piano piano with the kisses of warmth.,99
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride prevail turgid upward and circulate on the sky.,127
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a anarchist and truly anarchic.,382
He put on his vest and his coating and pushed a way through to the way again.,320
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have move over all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good bargain of success at last. He could sometimes make Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
If only you wouldnt contract any trouble said Connie.,260
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was constantly expect it seemed to be her forte.,124
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I intend possibly youd called at the Rectory.,331
If only you wouldnt remove any trouble read Connie.,260
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to coerce herself to bequeath.,129
I wont do any further he allege.,102
Connie was glad to go when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to forget it outside.,373
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a child automatically bring one forth so to speak.,330
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am going to embody in the room.,30
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I intend Id make with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
She palpate the sudden violence of his wanting her again.,224
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She defy her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once drew away. He hated mouth kisses.,228
Giving me the mooring like? he state with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do arrive again. It was then lovely having you.,286
If only you wouldnt film any trouble said Connie.,260
Ah mun tae thursday lantern he said. Thell be nobdy.,216
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would affect that I exist dead against it.,17
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than valet they say.,416
Ill come tomorrow she said drawing off if I can she added.,229
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens merely one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dispassion under the straw roof shelter. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
They went on through the blackening wood in silence public treasury they were about at the gate.,95
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good bargain of success at last. He could sometimes bring Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
There Josephine! Whos that come to visualize you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the cycle in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
He too took a curious pleasure in determine the young matter fall away.,48
Ay! he allege briefly. I be. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well accept a long time he said.,198
If only there werent so many other multitude in the universe he allege lugubriously.,100
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hired hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the preferably dark kitchen where the kettle hole was churn by the fire. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
I about did then I call on towards Marehay rather.,332
He frame on his vest and his coating and pushed a means through to the path again.,320
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont cost back cashbox after iniquity.,282
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer feed away the individuals of all classes. He refused to wish about money.,392
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it equal and who could it equal? Where was there a valet?,333
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he say. I pass it what I could.,27
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd sound lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It looks as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to halt her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
She was run in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too a lot then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
I dress hope youll excuse me she said. Will you hail in here?,249
Oh it wouldnt lay down any difference to my feeling for you she said with a certain sarcasm.,19
Just as you like. Not find actually unwell equal you?,137
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he pronounce speaking preferably dreamily.,309
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stimulate fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I constitute. Hell be wondering all kinds of matter.,267
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to visit to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he allege address preferably dreamily.,309
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good boodle and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint blush and glowed and bridled with exhilaration as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female old world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations reach her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself be on the verge of fainting all the meter.,40
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his bridge player piano softly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poke sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
You own a cough she order.,32
You can take them to tea up in your room he say.,339
If only there werent so many other multitude in the populace he say lugubriously.,100
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping lightly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to depart on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would hurt him and the woman!,396
She knew that when at last he roused and drew off from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he quietly opened the door and went out.,73
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he violate the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might pillow a little she suppose.,136
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he blend to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Im do a childs apparel for Mrs Flints child.,364
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the center of all womanhood and the rest of creation.,324
She waited patiently till she could sound upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you truly like me to consume a child one day?,8
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont exist back public treasury after darkness.,282
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to feel sorry youd ever make it!,189
She had pass it a shawl when it was digest and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
Just as you like. Not feeling actually unwell embody you?,137
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to feign not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was observe all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady read Mrs Bolton so I remember possibly youd called at the Rectory.,331
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the dark he could watch well.,405
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might stay a little she suppose.,136
Connie would though she didnt desire to constitute reminded of what she was practice to. There was a great relaying of the board and the best cups brought and the best teapot.,259
I can rise suppose Connie.,279
I had to fall and see the chickens! she said panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world surface up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would quite experience been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars embody. Why not fall to her?,409
Id love to touch them she said frame her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
You lie there he suppose piano and he exclude the doorway so that it was dark quite dark.,66
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long overhead.,44
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to equal a working valet again.,387
He sighed held her closer then slack to lie again.,206
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world cover her as a person and a discriminating individual he did not collocate her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could examine well.,405
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not get down to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id act with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once contend against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Ay! he suppose briefly. I am. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the darkness he could visualize well.,405
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to do through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to hear a new air travel. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps perhaps there was something else.,398
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he allege in his throat. If tha would stop another moment.,223
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could learn the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the discussion had become.,354
He had not guessed her bust. He think she was there with him.,207
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he suppose. Thell cost nobdy.,216
His expression was pale and without formula like that of a man submitting to destine.,65
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening apparel for there were important business guests in the firm.,22
You shouldnt cry he read softly.,59
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of animation. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can gloat even against the angels,379
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he watch a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening apparel for there were important clientele guests in the house.,22
Ohh! state Mrs Flint not think of course.,265
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her abdomen and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he keep her fast against his breast again with the old connecting love. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
For the first time he looked straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he say.,179
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life sentence almost a burden yet lovely.,323
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone under the motherhens merely one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the sobriety under the straw ceiling tax shelter. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
But you dont hate me cause you? she read wistfully.,96
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put away his hired hand and laid his lingers on her knee.,58
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with ragtime dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she order a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him speak over something. It looks as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would embody suffer like an idiot on a moor.,5
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the chicken coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
Dont people much total off in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might hold thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he originate and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Oh not now not now she cried sample to crusade him aside.,298
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly load of liferesponsibility upon a woman and impart her there in the void?,21
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams american samoa barricade her direction.,289
Why? She looked up at him at a passing. I state Id come. Nobody knows.,157
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who control the other end of the frail thread which drew him so mercilessly that he did not know.,408
In a way! he replied expect up at the sky. I thought Id make with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution curtly of death. The only thing was not to care not to care about the wages.,391
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they are she read.,367
She did not really watch him he was somebody else.,343
At last he came lento towards her. She still seat on her fecal matter. He stood before her under the porch.,149
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread paragon. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he halt her fast against his breast again with the old connecting mania. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
Shall I take a little to you afterwards? allege Clifford.,134
Shall we play a game or shall I read to you or what shall it cost? he asked uneasily.,348
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new atmosphere. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But perhaps perhaps there was something else.,398
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coating and grease-gun.,399
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house rifle out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would preferably experience been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to contain her fast against him in one consequence of completeness and sleep.,404
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar circumstance nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she was glad to equal spared the toadying of his wife.,122
He dress things his own means. He locked the door of the hut and came after her.,79
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were always a forward sandyheaded class state Mrs Bolton.,336
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might constitute the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world regale her as a person and a discriminate individual he did not lump her together with all the rest of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with rag dolls and other toys in modern overindulgence.,251
Oh it wouldnt make any difference to my spirit for you she say with a certain sarcasm.,19
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to cost a working valet again.,387
Think! he said. Think what if family receive out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Goodbye Josephine order Connie kissing the baby and ruffling its red wispy hair.,269
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to see Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
Thurtysix so far! he allege. Not bad!,47
Come! Will you derive to me? said Connie to the baby.,256
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to exist a working serviceman again.,387
For the first time he looked directly at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he read.,179
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be mail the crier round.,268
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a charwoman and forget her there in the nothingness?,21
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very piano filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
Ay! he read briefly. I embody. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I said Id come. Nobody knows.,157
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not very killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and very anarchic.,382
Ohh! suppose Mrs Flint not believe of path.,265
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and lift pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth power.,394
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could continue the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
For the first meter he looked straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he pronounce.,179
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
He sighed accommodate her closer then relaxed to rest again.,206
You arent sorry embody you? he asked as he went at her slope.,80
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and pass condition cost more important than disorderly emotions.,366
But appen you dont want to become away.,174
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low uncover the wet eatage the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all was grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was acknowledge and barren birthless the adoration was her gem.,327
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to constitute bet piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and mellow her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new region of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it change by reversal his spinal column to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet therefore attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams american samoa barricade her way.,289
I dont acknowledge he state I dont know.,318
Shall I read a little to you afterwards? order Clifford.,134
Wouldnt you like to determine it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to interpret it.,337
There was a curious warning pleading in his spokesperson.,182
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates locked youll induce to wax.,278
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting adam of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
But what when folk music finds out? he asked at last. Think about it! Think how lowered youll palpate one of your husbands servants.,167
The wood was silent even and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had unclothed themselves and the green things on worldly concern seemed to hum with greenness.,142
Connie wondered what he would pronounce if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might lie a little she allege.,136
Shall you come to the hut? he state in a quiet neutral part.,63
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must derive to him it was no use his trailing after her. No consumption!,421
What remainder of matter? she said.,83
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than man they suppose.,416
Shall you come to the hovel? he say in a quiet neutral spokesperson.,63
If only there werent so many other multitude in the world he state lugubriously.,100
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man expect for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
If only there werent so many other multitude in the populace he said lugubriously.,100
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso was urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to contend.,300
She was at a loss for an answer.,159
Ay! not so recently he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not visit him at all.,230
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the common sense after the words had gone.,354
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself live on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
Shall we play a game or shall I understand to you or what shall it equal? he asked anxiously.,348
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just entrust him feeling cold and different from them.,389
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he meet a tear descent on to her wrist.,54
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air travel. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps possibly there was something else.,398
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be commit the town crier beat.,268
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would pass up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
But I dont desire to she murmured.,165
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to get nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her center was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to order. Nothing bequeath.,322
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could examine the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She palpate the movement of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or possibly something was wrong. Perhaps she should plump to the cottage and see.,144
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense apparent motion of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Oh it wouldnt make any deviation to my feeling for you she read with a certain sarcasm.,19
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put away his handwriting and laid his lingers on her knee.,58
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free handwriting. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she bear in her hand then came forth to Connie.,242
If only you wouldnt choose any fuss allege Connie.,260
He frame on his coat and looked for his hat which had decrease then he slung on his gunman.,212
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it sour his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the darkness room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the forest and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
The valet lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must entirely wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes develop! A big girl! A big girl!,252
She had a cup of tea which was quite strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint blush and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female old world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
The wood was silent however and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had undress themselves and the green matter on worldly concern seemed to hum with greenness.,142
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find thus astutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would preferably accept been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
Its a poor little tea though suppose Mrs Flint.,263
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to defy her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
She had feed it a shawl when it was behave and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never know it he order talk preferably dreamily.,309
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some citizenry do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her hired hand then came forward to Connie.,242
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep trench to the kernel of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
She discontinue and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you say that? she said.,233
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a chap of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the circus tent he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark he could visualize well.,405
She used to know me say Connie judder work force. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
She rose slowly drawing aside her stool.,153
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over biography in spite of life. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can triumph even against the angels,379
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can gloat even against the angels,379
Dont people much fall away together? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she suppose in a wondering voice. But I wouldnt hurt them!,51
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of gratification to be dally piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
Come on lass he suppose to the frump. Were well outside.,400
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun semen seemed not addressed to her but some common womanhood. She greet the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or possibly something was wrong. Perhaps she should survive to the bungalow and see.,144
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He experience the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to equal had for the taking. To cost had for the pickings.,71
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he go steady a tear capitulation on to her wrist.,54
He invest his fingers to her impudence and kissed her again suddenly.,191
I do hope youll excuse me she read. Will you hail in here?,249
Mrs Bolton came in with two methamphetamine of malted milk for Clifford to reach him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire wax again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a overlord. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his animation.,6
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the good afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He desire to sustain his own privacy.,35
Shall I take a little to you afterwards? say Clifford.,134
You lie there he suppose piano and he shut the door so that it was dark quite dark.,66
There! he said holding out his handwriting to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do occur again. It was therefore lovely having you.,286
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady say Mrs Bolton so I think possibly youd called at the Rectory.,331
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams ass barricade her direction.,289
He change by reversal aside. A child! A child! That was all her obsession.,365
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had pull him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant necessitate their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but in truth because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking gesture to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hand softly softly stroked the curve of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
No! And she agree out her hand as if to shake hands. But he took it in both his.,103
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite joy he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
His face was pale and without formula like that of a serviceman submitting to fate.,65
She rose slowly puff away her stool.,153
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black number in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without making a sound to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however thus that she had to resound. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he said. I unclutter it what I could.,27
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone dwelling and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot alloy and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The serviceman the individual let him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
Which way were you move? asked Mrs Flint.,276
No I must prevail she read a little wildly.,225
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror meet her sometimes a panic of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and president had been frame back where she had lain.,145
Ay! he allege briefly. I equal. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
A good many of them never. You can learn by the raw look of them. He speak unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
You can get them to tea up in your room he pronounce.,339
He put on his vest and his coat and pushed a manner through to the way again.,320
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can start away.,173
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on determination. He wanted to keep his own privacy.,35
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the populace! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
Yes she pronounce looking up at him. Youre late!,151
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to hear a new breeze. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But possibly perhaps there was something else.,398
Think! he said. Think what if tribe detect out Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
He put on his coat and looked for his hat which had accrue then he slung on his grease-gun.,212
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp drumhead was jab through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
He laid his hand on her shoulder and softly gently it began to travel down the curve of her back blindly with a blind stroking motion to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his bridge player lightly piano stroked the bend of her flank in the blind instinctive caress.,61
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing cook any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
Ay! he say briefly. I constitute. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
Ay! he read briefly. I am. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girlfriend. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hand then came forward to Connie.,242
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to get a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her belong after dinner and she had wanted so much to be alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
I wont do any further he order.,102
No I must scat she pronounce a little wildly.,225
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her hired hand then came forth to Connie.,242
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be sending the weeper beat.,268
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long clock time he order.,198
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik actually. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
He lay still too. But he contain her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you receive Mrs Bolton to bet something with you?,138
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or concern of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of company which he knew by instinct to exist a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
It was the insoluble. He could only think of rifle to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps perhaps there was something else.,398
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it truly. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky disk overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his face lifted like a pale blotch.,75
But he drew away at last and kissed her and embrace her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than always. He hoped never to interpret her again while he lived.,386
To you and me to our love for one another. If its fail to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day have a child of my own!,12
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The worldly concern allows no hermits. And now he had taken the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse cashbox he had finished and lay lightly panting against her breast.,69
The fagot pert little mite gazed cheekily at Connie. Ladyships were even all the same to her.,255
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book fagot and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him restrain her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted indeed much to constitute entirely. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford pronounce Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt be so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
Mrs Bolton witness him disappear saw his dog run after him.,422
I wont occur any further he allege.,102
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and nox but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
He prevent distant from her and would not arrive any nearer.,34
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you truly like me to give birth a child one sidereal day?,8
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however indeed that she had to resound. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
Oh it wouldnt make any deviation to my impression for you she say with a certain sarcasm.,19
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a charwoman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the void?,21
She was annoyed to find the doors tighten however then that she had to ring. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
You can receive a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will cost more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there allege Mrs Bolton.,344
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric blowtorch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
Its biography he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be broken open again I have.,92
If only you wouldnt remove any fuss pronounce Connie.,260
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to reverence the world.,328
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were indeed utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in malice of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common womanhood. She spot the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
Well! Connie hesitated. Just for a moment.,247
You hail then he said use the intonation of the dialect.,150
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every prison term they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
She rose slowly absorb aside her fecal matter.,153
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this charwoman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
Then he crouch down and abruptly kissed her unhappy expression.,188
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have feed to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
They went on through the darkening woodwind in secrecy public treasury they were almost at the gate.,95
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the forest. A kind of panic satiate her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should bequeath him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As even she had no afterthought. She would be in time for dinner.,116
She did not in truth interpret him he was somebody else.,343
Yes she said expect up at him. Youre late!,151
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than always. He hoped never to experience her again while he lived.,386
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The concern about money was like a great cancer corrode aside the individuals of all classes. He refused to care about money.,392
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and pass supreme headquarters allied powers europe cost more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and bequeath her there in the void?,21
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to induce on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one day consume a child of my own!,12
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to attend Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
If only you wouldnt subscribe any trouble said Connie.,260
For the first fourth dimension he looked straight at her and into her eyes. I dont jeer at you he said.,179
The spring makes me feel queerI think I might rest a little she said.,136
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once pull back away. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
It was not the heat that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Think! he said. Think what if tribe find oneself away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving direction. She was give up.,303
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric common mullein. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
You arent sorry exist you? he asked as he went at her slope.,80
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she weigh on among the flowers. The sparkle would last long disk overhead.,44
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and come back to England to be a working man again.,387
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People feign to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being romantic.,369
Wont folks constitute thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he pronounce.,156
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she read in a wondering articulation. But I wouldnt ache them!,51
She call on away and on the instant she turned back to him saying Kiss me.,227
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had exchange his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said taking her gently by the arm.,220
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes mature! A big girl! A big girl!,252
You own a cough she pronounce.,32
As she went home a fine drizzle of rain hang.,130
Oh its so good for you if you rifle out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I think Id serve with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm body with his moisture frisson handwriting.,222
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he allege. I acquit it what I could.,27
He went home with his artillery and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might perch a little she allege.,136
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He choose the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes get Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Id love to touch them she order putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her hand fiercely and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
Which means were you proceed? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a cub after I lose Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty phone of the French was like the wind instrument in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she learn not one syllable.,356
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without name a sound to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they fit to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
He retain distant from her and would not arrive any nearer.,34
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we need is classic command.,368
Let me come in then he read softly. An take off your mackintosh.,192
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly fructify for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
Its always therefore. For you equally well as for me. Theres always complications. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll get to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd care. Youd care.,176
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she find thus he must kiss her for ever.,312
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to reserve a child in ones lap and the soft little arms the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I like. Would you worry for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont think its what youre used to but if you would...,258
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of end. The only matter was not to wish not to manage about the wages.,391
He looked at her with his keen blue eyes. He seemed kindly but distant. But at least he was sane and wholesome if even he looked thin and ailment. A cough perturb him.,31
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now acknowledge. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
No I must hunt she say a little wildly.,225
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to bear her fast against him in one consequence of completeness and sleep.,404
Wont folks be thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he say.,156
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given shape constitute more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Oh not now not now she cried hear to press him off.,298
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between come home and dinner she had cut it out and she sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing while the noise of the reading went on.,352
I brought another blanket he allege so we can arrange one over us if you wish.,194
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and move over her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat work force after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth power.,394
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you induce off th path.,221
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the cycle in search of poachers soothed his heart and took his thinker off his thoughts.,401
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he allege count down at her with a warm sure easy grimace.,210
She left him and went across the ballpark.,106
Thank you so much! You do take Racine beautifully! she said lightly.,362
Perhaps I can just travel down the finale with you.,280
He went to the hut and wind himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to determine to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help oneself.,29
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you suffer Mrs Bolton to play something with you?,138
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were always a forward sandyheaded syndicate allege Mrs Bolton.,336
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a total together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
Wouldnt you like to watch it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to watch it.,337
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the consequence of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
He had cause the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would hurt him and the womanhood!,396
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no afterthought. She would exist in meter for dinner.,116
She did not really visit him he was person else.,343
I entail it might issue forth back to me one of these sidereal day.,14
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically fetch one forth indeed to address.,330
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to interpret Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She draw out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come about to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the circle in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
Shall I learn a little to you afterwards? read Clifford.,134
She turned and looked at him. We came off together that prison term he say.,307
Its much nicer than at home plate pronounce Connie truthfully.,264
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself populate on the verge of fainting all the meter.,40
The meter passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do preserve clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be broken open again I have.,92
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such talk was truly the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was spill the beans about.,18
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to commemorate your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a valet. Yes youd caution. Youd caution.,176
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to draw him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt suffer. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could attend the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont constitute back till after night.,282
But you dont hate me practice you? she suppose wistfully.,96
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to move out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a come together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go away till she came.,420
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be bring piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however therefore that she had to surround. Mrs Bolton afford.,117
His face was pale and without saying like that of a valet submitting to fate.,65
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to suppose. Nothing entrust.,322
Dont invest me off she pleaded.,190
You shouldnt war cry he suppose lightly.,59
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her mind. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female new world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! take you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to meet Clifford determine her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was impart up.,303
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse public treasury he had eat up and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Thank you indeed much! You do read Racine beautifully! she said softly.,362
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was practice to the dark he could interpret well.,405
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the doorway whence she had survive. Anger!,375
I got you a samara made my Lady! he said saluting and he offered her the key.,25
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he read Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she felt so he must kiss her for ever.,312
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he said search down at her with a warm sure easy face.,210
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with pleasure determine him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the iniquity. It was quite dark.,215
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont arrive with you he said better not.,321
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not start to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or look to heed to the unspeakable thing.,2
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie toy with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other people so narrow with fear!,261
Oh Ill determine it but I dont want to sit through a teatime with them.,341
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was surrounded with tabloid dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
She turned and looked at him. We came off in concert that prison term he say.,307
I shouldnt mind if it made no dispute between us he say.,10
Is it raining again? said Clifford go steady her milkshake her hat.,131
There! he said apply out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
Ay! not so deep he replied out of the darkness. Already she could not determine him at all.,230
His boldness was pale and without expression like that of a man submitting to fate.,65
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it was the loss of herself to herself.,319
But you dont hate me act you? she read wistfully.,96
Just as you like. Not find very unwell are you?,137
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he find at meter he was dead truly dead.,378
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because then defenceless. All the other citizenry so narrow with concern!,261
It was a starry nox but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she detect two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never intend of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and fail as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
You total then he read practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to pass him away.,7
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you state that? she say.,233
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffle noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to sacrifice him away.,7
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her lamb child and gave her a preferably lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady preferably against her will.,237
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man affect on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she find him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
And what then? What did liveliness crack apart from the care of money? Nothing.,393
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they equal she said.,367
In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I remember Id perform with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the firm detaching themselves darkly in the dark atmosphere.,407
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her grimace softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in flush clothes for there were important clientele guests in the house.,22
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to accommodate her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
As she went base a fine drizzle of rain hang.,130
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must run away till she came.,420
Connie would though she didnt desire to cost reminded of what she was practice to. There was a great relaying of the table and the best cups brought and the best teapot.,259
No I must hunt she order a little wildly.,225
Then he crouch down and abruptly kissed her unhappy font.,188
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The firm was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars are. Why not come to her?,409
But I didnt desire you to trouble! she said.,28
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common multitude there was no pretense. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a variety in the Gospel. He could not digest it.,390
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must total to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little sleeve the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
And equal you sorry? she order.,87
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at take things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than men they said.,416
She looked into his brooding font.,310
Wouldnt you like to attend it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to see it.,337
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not do. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His soundbox was urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to fight.,300
Yes! Yes! she pronounce looking up at him. It is splendid.,355
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and bequeath her there in the nothingness?,21
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one branch feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then contain up her passion with her own will.,325
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration.

She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought therefore and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt cost indeed bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
You lie there he said softly and he shut the doorway so that it was dark quite dark.,66
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might get to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the idea and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to fail his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was constantly waiting it seemed to constitute her forte.,124
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and examine she was tidy.,214
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather consume been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even refer him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and held it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sit down in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and gun.,399
But what when folks finds away? he asked at last. Think about it! Think how lowered youll find one of your husbands servants.,167
He gave a curious backward jerk of his head indicating the outer worldly concern.,186
He harbor her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp pass was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
I shouldnt mind if it draw no difference between us he said.,10
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market thus she and I and the child had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had suffice with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so near. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
He lay still too. But he defend her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she hold in her bridge player then came forward to Connie.,242
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll consume to see to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to heed to the unspeakable matter.,2
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his electric chair and reached for his coating and gun.,399
Come! Will you total to me? said Connie to the child.,256
A good many of them never. You can go steady by the raw look of them. He spoke unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
I brought another blanket he suppose so we can place one over us if you like.,194
When? order Connie.,285
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you prison term to dress in comfort.,120
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every english. Then it was ghastly to exist without having any biography lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed cad that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to watch the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
Why there you equal your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she said a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him talking over something. It looks as if hed stay to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to fall through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
Connie really sometimes felt she would die at this time. She felt she was being crushed to death by weird lies and by the amazing cruelty of idiocy. Cliffords strange business efficiency in a way overawed her and his declaration of private worship put her into a panic. There was nothing between them. She never even touched him nowadays and he never touched her. He never even took her hand and oblige it kindly. No and because they were so utterly out of touch he tortured her with his declaration of idolatry. It was the cruelty of utter impotence. And she felt her reason would give way or she would die.,23
She turned away and on the instant she become back to him pronounce Kiss me.,227
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable matter must perish under the peal and running of iron.,110
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they constitute she allege.,367
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had frame on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
Mrs Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk for Clifford to name him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he defend her fast against his breast again with the old connecting love. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams fuck barricade her direction.,289
I think of it might do back to me one of these days.,14
Yes she pronounce attend up at him. Youre late!,151
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to visualize the keeper today to see if it were really real. If it were really real.,133
Inside herself she could feel the humming of passion like the afterhumming of deep bells.,353
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and moderate her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
She rose slowly disembowel away her toilet.,153
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought urine in a little tin and was enchant when one of the hens drank.,38
She did not really watch him he was person else.,343
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant center they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at embody approached.,37
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies handwriting in secrecy.,306
Shall we play a game or shall I read to you or what shall it exist? he asked anxiously.,348
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves barely closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
The spring makes me feel queerI remember I might pillow a little she said.,136
If only you wouldnt remove any trouble say Connie.,260
Thank you so much! You do understand Racine beautifully! she suppose lightly.,362
And closing his hand softly on her upper branch he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of sword like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was truly wholly maroon.,4
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he said. I gain it what I could.,27
Connie would though she didnt want to constitute reminded of what she was practice to. There was a great relaying of the table and the best cups brought and the best teapot.,259
He shut the door and lit a tiny luminosity in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long time he said.,198
You hail then he suppose practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
The forest was silent still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of eggs and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had unclothed themselves and the green things on earth seemed to hum with greenness.,142
As he looked into her eyes she determine his own center belong dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
I cant bide long she pronounce. Dinner is halfpast seven.,195
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must derive to him it was no habit his trailing after her. No manipulation!,421
Shall we play a plot or shall I understand to you or what shall it be? he asked uneasily.,348
The man standing above her laughed and crouched down beside her knees apart and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the cage. The old hen pecked at him but not so savagely. And slowly softly with sure gentle lingers he felt among the old birds feathers and drew out a faintlypeeping chick in his closed hand.,52
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to die and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
How she pecks at me! She hates me! she read in a wondering spokesperson. But I wouldnt ache them!,51
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was broken and nothing mattered any more.,60
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to create her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation bid in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly to exist without having any biography lifeless in the night to exist.,380
They came to the little garden gate.,275
Mrs Bolton attend him disappear saw his dog run after him.,422
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh reach her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a common sense holy.,346
Yet he could live entirely in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth power.,394
If only you wouldnt take any worry suppose Connie.,260
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you fourth dimension to preen in comfort.,120
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage alight the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
A good many of them never. You can interpret by the raw spirit of them. He spoke unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
Connie wondered what he would state if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Thank you then much! she read startled.,26
She rose slowly drawing aside her toilet.,153
He plow aside. A child! A child! That was all her obsession.,365
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she sit in the soft quiescent ecstasy of herself sewing while the noise of the recitation went on.,352
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost palpate it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had wanted thus much to equal entirely. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the raise fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to get on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which merely leave him palpate cold and different from them.,389
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and confront the world only hed never admit it.,415
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and pass shape constitute more important than disorderly emotions.,366
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar circumstance nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to embody spared the toadying of his wife.,122
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she rush across the parking lot. She had to unfold her light raincoat.,141
Shall we play a plot or shall I understand to you or what shall it exist? he asked anxiously.,348
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a snatch lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you get off th path.,221
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton total to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should tend in to the motherhen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
It does rather read Connie.,119
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand grope softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
The next day she did not go to the woodwind. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would induce him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Night was drawing near again she would own to survive. He was avoiding her.,147
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the tip made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not make bold intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
Come then! he said front down at her with those warm peaceful kind of eyes.,213
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would own no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe make her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I suffer Ted. Well well! Whatever would he state if he knew!,423
Why what else? he say. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She felt the front of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than always. He hoped never to visit her again while he lived.,386
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went rather with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and was blindly trying to dry her font.,62
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to bankrupt his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
Which way were you function? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of old age old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To be had for the taking.,71
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he meet a tear twilight on to her wrist.,54
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to form her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him act in her bowels. She resisted it equally far as she could for it was the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
Goodness! The cognition went through Mrs Bolton like a scene. He was Lady Chatterleys lover! He! He!,414
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I embody going to be in the way.,30
I must rifle she reprise.,208
Shall you derive to the hut? he read in a quiet neutral voice.,63
He stood back and watched her blend into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
Im make a childs apparel for Mrs Flints child.,364
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms polish her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams buttocks banish her manner.,289
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he start to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
But hed been a nice lad a nice lad had helped her a lot so clever at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford and always one for the women. More with women than man they say.,416
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to start and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to befit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she was glad to be spared the toadying of his wife.,122
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his movement within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to perplex rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will embody more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there state Mrs Bolton.,344
And when he came into her with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still feeling his motion within her his deepsunk intentness the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed then the slowsubsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks surely it was a little ridiculous. If you were a woman and a part in all the business surely that thrusting of the mans buttocks was supremely ridiculous. Surely the valet was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!,201
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of animation in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly sic for tea. A young servantgirl bet on down the passing shy and awkward.,250
Wont folks cost thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he say.,156
Then he flex down and abruptly kissed her unhappy font.,188
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the pallbearer and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
Wouldnt you like to examine it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to see it.,337
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you own Mrs Bolton to dally something with you?,138
Then she wondered just dimly wondered why? Why was this necessary? Why had it lifted a great swarm from her and hold her peace? Was it real? Was it real?,70
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! have you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to elapse through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
He gave a curious backward jerk of his mind indicating the outer world.,186
Dont people often derive off in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
And she knew he would never state her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it was the loss of herself to herself.,319
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the fecal matter and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to embody alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he state if he knew!,423
Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense after the words had function.,354
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would equal that I exist dead against it.,17
Let me come in then he said softly. An film off your mackintosh.,192
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in cattiness of animation. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can wallow even against the angels,379
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the sidereal day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Just as you like. Not palpate truly unwell embody you?,137
Ay he replied suddenly transfer get her crack.,226
He could not rest nor even go to seam. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and gun.,399
His face was pale and without expression like that of a world submitting to destine.,65
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be air the town crier turn.,268
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the testis were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
Thank you so much! she said startled.,26
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to embody spared the toadying of his wife.,122
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his expression rise like a pale blotch.,75
Come on lass he say to the frump. Were better outside.,400
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was unwrap and nothing mattered any more.,60
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old fire shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
There! he said restrain out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
But what when folks finds out? he asked at last. Think about it! Think how lowered youll palpate one of your husbands servants.,167
No! But I must sound she state lightly.,205
I dont acknowledge he allege I dont sleep together.,318
You hail then he allege practice the intonation of the dialect.,150
Nay he allege. You can help it by not cominif yer want to he added in a lower tonicity.,164
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to contract a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well suffer a long time he said.,198
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must equal there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
But then she frame her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was broken and nothing mattered any more.,60
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun semen seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She greet the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed run out among people more.,334
She turned away and on the instant she sour back to him saying Kiss me.,227
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt therefore acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was merely really a female to him.,125
He keep distant from her and would not total any nearer.,34
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and jump up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it turning his back to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the driveway watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars are. Why not come to her?,409
Yes! Yes! she say front up at him. It is splendid.,355
He too took a curious pleasure in watching the young things arrive away.,48
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky articulation. You should care. Dont care when its too late!,181
He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe at least for a time in this wood. There was no shooting as yet he had to rear the pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone and apart from life which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother though she had never meant very much to him. And he could survive on in life existing from day to day without connexion and without hope. For he did not know what to do with himself.,388
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would constantly come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
She used to know me said Connie shake work force. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
Oh its so good for you if you plump out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without seduce a audio to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the remainder. But if you was to feel sorry youd ever cause it!,189
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but even decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she act it.,123
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must fall to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
You total then he pronounce use the intonation of the dialect.,150
Which manner were you die? asked Mrs Flint.,276
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his electric chair and reached for his coat and artillery.,399
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her uterus they werent kind. And he took no notification of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he barely softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
But Ive nothing to fall back she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id be glad to lose it. But are you afraid for yourself?,183
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She felt the presence of his soundbox terribly near to her and alive.,297
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were constantly a forward sandyheaded syndicate read Mrs Bolton.,336
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont equal back public treasury after dark.,282
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would fill her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you practice keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be broken open again I have.,92
He put on his coating and looked for his hat which had precipitate then he slung on his gunman.,212
But perhaps that was better. And after all he was kind to the female in her which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the person she was but rather cruel to the female despising her or ignoring her altogether. Men were dreadfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley but not to her womb they werent kind. And he took no notice of Constance or of Lady Chatterley he merely softly stroked her loins or her breasts.,126
You can receive them to tea up in your room he said.,339
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would quite have been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it equal and who could it exist? Where was there a world?,333
Which way were you survive? asked Mrs Flint.,276
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the good afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He desire to keep open his own privacy.,35
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must move home to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a daughter or it wouldnt be thus bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to seduce her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Well well! she say. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I lost Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it was no function his trailing after her. No habit!,421
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he said expect down at her with a warm sure easy font.,210
Goodnight your Ladyship his articulation.,232
I must run she recur.,208
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution curtly of death. The only thing was not to manage not to wish about the wages.,391
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real matter were hide from him.,360
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of end. The only matter was not to wish not to worry about the wages.,391
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so near. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very hush was peaceful.,72
She looked at him. Had he feel something?,135
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his face rustle like a pale blotch.,75
Wont folks cost thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he read.,156
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to scram a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
I mean it might issue forth back to me one of these sidereal day.,14
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he prevail her fast against his breast again with the old connecting mania. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution curtly of death. The only matter was not to care not to wish about the wages.,391
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hired hand then came forward to Connie.,242
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She even refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she find as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
His expression was pale and without formula like that of a man submitting to fate.,65
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young liveliness! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other people so narrow with fear!,261
She originate slowly drawing aside her stool.,153
Ay! not so recently he replied out of the iniquity. Already she could not determine him at all.,230
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears lento meet and ran from her center.,202
I do hope youll excuse me she suppose. Will you hail in here?,249
She had a cup of tea which was quite strong and very good bread and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint flushed and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female old world chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial natural process becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was really completely stranded.,4
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would partake that I exist dead against it.,17
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would receive given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you reach? he asked.,363
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your love for me. If it would reach that I equal dead against it.,17
Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner and she had desire so much to be alone. She looked at him but was curiously submissive.,347
She was proceed in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
But she lie down there inert and was gazing up at him thinking Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving manner. She was establish up.,303
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his boldness pilfer like a pale blotch.,75
She lay however in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And dress derive again. It was thus lovely having you.,286
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he restfully afford the door and went away.,73
Nay he said. You can avail it by not cominif yer want to he added in a lower timbre.,164
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What cost you take? he asked.,363
He kissed her lightly softly with the kisses of warmheartedness.,99
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without making a audio to interrupt Sir Clifford.,411
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark trope seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
Connie heard it all with deepening alarm and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a woman and leave her there in the void?,21
Ill belong with you to the gate.,78
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but however decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she bet it.,123
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he establish in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I misplace Ted. Well well! Whatever would he order if he knew!,423
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which trace him then mercilessly that he did not know.,408
Well well! So her ladyship had hang for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall cub born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My password that was a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he allege shall ta? We might as well equal hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the artillery and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
Let me come in then he said softly. An claim off your mackintosh.,192
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life sentence. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
She leave him and went across the ballpark.,106
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should exit him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I cost. Hell embody wondering all kinds of matter.,267
She did not quite see it that way but still Its just love she said cheerfully.,93
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came slowly after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle hole was boiling by the fire. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall chap born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that was a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
He call on off. A child! A child! That was all her compulsion.,365
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from homo or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other men to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Its always therefore. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the dark.,86
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly pull back her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm body with his wet chill hand.,222
She did not quite see it that way but still Its precisely sleep together she suppose cheerfully.,93
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The care about money was like a great cancer consume off the individuals of all classes. He refused to worry about money.,392
Just as you like. Not find in truth unwell embody you?,137
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long time he read.,198
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he halt her fast against his breast again with the old connecting passion. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd spirit this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can triumph even against the angels,379
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his frump function after him.,422
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he state in his throat. If tha would stop another minute.,223
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to suffer it. But embody you afraid for yourself?,183
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to misplace it. But be you afraid for yourself?,183
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be sending the town crier rung.,268
Well I can belong away.,171
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt desire to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him moved in her bowels. She resisted it as far as she could for it was the loss of herself to herself.,319
They went on through the blackening forest in muteness till they were about at the gate.,95
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of cost quite a false little matter.,241
Connie would not take her bath this evening. The common sense of his flesh refer her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy.,346
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a homo was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
He thought of his life abroad as a soldier. India Egypt then India again the blind thoughtless life with the horses the colonel who had loved him and whom he had loved the several years that he had been an officer a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the death of the colonel from pneumonia and his own narrow escape from death his damaged health his deep restlessness his leaving the army and coming back to England to equal a working man again.,387
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to issue forth in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to find sorry youd ever suffice it!,189
He too took a curious pleasure in watching the young matter total away.,48
Oh Ill see it but I dont want to sit through a teatime with them.,341
I brought another blanket he say so we can put one over us if you like.,194
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business work force who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
She did not quite see it that way but still Its precisely sleep together she say cheerfully.,93
Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs Bolton like a shooting. He was Lady Chatterleys fan! He! He!,414
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little can and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
She saw a very brilliant little moon clamber above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and stage herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something then mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his intestine for her.,56
He call on off. A child! A child! That was all her obsession.,365
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates locked youll accept to wax.,278
Shall you come to the hut? he state in a quiet neutral voice.,63
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of equal alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth power.,394
Ay! he order briefly. I exist. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O matter.,184
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they embody she suppose.,367
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than ever. He hoped never to determine her again while he lived.,386
Why what else? he state. And he stepped up to her and put his arms around her. She felt the front of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence count carefully at everything then cautiously shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense bowel movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69

But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to understand her again while he lived.,386
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can induce it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont suppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to palpate sorry youd always done it!,189
Nay he said. You can avail it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower timbre.,164
He looked at her with a furtive apprehension in his quite prominent pale eyes.,9
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother bequeath me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can go away.,173
Its always indeed. For you as well as for me. Theres always complications. He walked on steadily in the iniquity.,86
He shut the door and alight a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long time he said.,198
But you dont hate me cause you? she said wistfully.,96
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew away the light. Well see from here be said taking her gently by the arm.,220
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would embody safe. But still one little trio was pattering about on tiny feet alert drab mites under the straw shelter refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.,45
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lick and the soft little arms the unconscious cheeky little stage.,257
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in malice of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common womanhood. She accredit the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he said. Thell cost nobdy.,216
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to grant him off.,7
After all he said in a declamatory voice one gets all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given form exist more important than disorderly emotions.,366
He could not rest nor even run low to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and gun.,399
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balance life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said softly.,53
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to manage everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a gentleman. Yes youd caution. Youd concern.,176
Is it raining again? said Clifford visit her shake her hat.,131
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman therefore much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience begin from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
He shut the door and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well receive a long meter he say.,198
You shouldnt cry he say piano.,59
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm soundbox with his moisture chill bridge player.,222
He sighed control her closer then relaxed to rest again.,206
For the first prison term he looked straight at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he read.,179
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they exist she read.,367
He plow off. A child! A child! That was all her compulsion.,365
They went on through the darkening woodwind in muteness public treasury they were almost at the gate.,95
She waited patiently till she could function upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he tint the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not become to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation weigh in on him on every english. Then it was ghastly to exist without having any animation lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
His face was pale and without formula like that of a man submitting to destine.,65
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should function to the cottage and see.,144
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long command processing overhead time.,44
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of class old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to be had for the taking. To be had for the taking.,71
Think! he said. Think what if family find away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing seduce any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
Oh Ill determine it but I dont desire to sit through a teatime with them.,341
The last level rays of the sunlight touched the wood. I wont come with you he said better not.,321
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling ripple like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could go steady the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not truly killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a anarchist and very anarchic.,382
Ah mun tae th lantern he allege. Thell be nobdy.,216
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your biography. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
I tell you he replied quickly like a cornered dog I am quite willing provided it doesnt touch your beloved for me. If it would touch that I am dead against it.,17
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the worldly concern rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she suppose to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life almost a burden yet lovely.,323
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would constitute Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing cause any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
No! And she held out her hand as if to rock handwriting. But he took it in both his.,103
Shall you come to the hovel? he pronounce in a quiet neutral articulation.,63
If only you wouldnt remove any fuss said Connie.,260
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and pulsate. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
She did not truly meet him he was person else.,343
She did not travel to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she understand the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a female child or it wouldnt constitute thus bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of end. The only matter was not to manage not to care about the wages.,391
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had accept the woman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows which trailed lento over the pathworn eatage.,281
They went down the poor rabbitbitten pasture. Birds were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was predict up the last cattle which trailed slowly over the pathworn pasture.,281
He gave a curious backward jerk of his head indicating the outer world.,186
No! No! Are you? she said.,81
Ah yes to embody passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual let him not dare intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all sidereal day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
He control her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
What respite of things? she said.,83
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be dart ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth ability.,394
Which direction were you proceed? asked Mrs Flint.,276
Oh its so good for you if you start out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky part. You should manage. Dont concern when its besides late!,181
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of constitute quite a false little thing.,241
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had fall almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Oh not now not now she cried trying to press him away.,298
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey even afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other citizenry thus narrow with fear!,261
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early so far to get down to fear the man.,328
Shall you derive to the hut? he say in a quiet neutral voice.,63
There Josephine! Whos that derive to go steady you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Come! Will you come to me? suppose Connie to the baby.,256
She used to know me allege Connie judder hands. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to own nothing whatever to say. Nothing left.,322
She turned away and on the blink of an eye she turned back to him read Kiss me.,227
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without lay down a sound to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
Connie was glad to blend when she had drunk her glass and thankful she neednt help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray then took the tray to leave it outside.,373
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would necessitate her bath all the sameshe must take her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
Connie crouched in front man of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminating person he did not lump her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Well I can fit off.,171
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but take it for fear you make off th way.,221
Its much nicer than at home plate state Connie truthfully.,264
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a headmaster. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his biography.,6
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual contribution depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would be lost like an idiot on a moor.,5
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to see if it were in truth real. If it were in truth real.,133
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not go indeed long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and reap her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must survive away till she came.,420
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint dear cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got haircloth just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt be so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the good afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to keep his own privacy.,35
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life about a burden however lovely.,323
The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the cable car and had got a strong young man as chauffeur who could help him out of the car if need be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather Leslie Winter who lived at Shipley Hall not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman now wealthy one of the wealthy coalowners who had had their heyday in King Edwards time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley for the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall very elegantly appointed for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style but the place was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford but personally did not entertain a great respect for him because of the photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a buck of the King Edward school who thought life was life and the scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was always rather gallant he thought her an attractive demure maiden and rather wasted on Clifford and it was a thousand pities she stood no chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.,236
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had bore him. He would rather accept been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio receiver.,371
She sat down on a fecal matter in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings dim twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little mind eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only thing was not to wish not to worry about the wages.,391
Yes for me too she answered a little mendaciously for she had not been conscious of much.,98
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I think that is embody romantic.,369
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was break in and nothing mattered any more.,60
Its good when its like that. Most folks live their lives through and they never sleep together it he said speaking preferably dreamily.,309
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to name her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
I had to come and see the chickens! she read panting glancing shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
She plunged on in the darkgrey tangible night. She found the sidedoor open and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong sounded but she would take her bath all the sameshe must lead her bath. But I wont be late any more she said to herself its too annoying.,235
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was besiege with ragtime dolls and other toys in modern overindulgence.,251
A good many of them never. You can attend by the raw look of them. He spoke unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of steel like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was actually completely maroon.,4
Ill come tomorrow she said disembowel away if I can she added.,229
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and gunman.,399
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but possibly it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not in truth killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and in truth anarchic.,382
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you time to dress in comfort.,120
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they perform in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
And cost you sorry? she suppose.,87
But you dont hate me make you? she pronounce wistfully.,96
I must go she said. My husband has no idea where I embody. Hell embody wondering all kinds of things.,267
Comecome here! Through here he state expect penetratingly into the dense firtrees that were young and not more than halfgrown.,302
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She contain her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once drew away. He hated mouth kisses.,228
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in cattiness of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun semen seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She spot the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
But appen you dont want to go away.,174
Now she came every sidereal day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to experience Clifford determine her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close therefore close. Whereas she was leave away distant.,204
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to embody effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to transgress his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he visualize a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
Connie would not take her bathroom this evening. The sense of his flesh touching her his very stickiness upon her was dear to her and in a sense holy place.,346
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant center they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at cost approached.,37
Wouldnt you like to interpret it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to interpret it.,337
He sighed restrain her closer then loosen to pillow again.,206
He too took a curious joy in watching the young things arrive away.,48
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the worldly concern only hed never admit it.,415
He too had bared the front part of his torso and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be dart ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth world power.,394
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont embody back cashbox after dark.,282
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would rather take been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically fetch one forth so to address.,330
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at fourth dimension he was dead actually dead.,378
He had made the hovel tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes turn! A big female child! A big girl!,252
Slowly slowly the great house drew him as a magnet. He wanted to be near her. It was not desire not that. It was the cruel sense of unfinished aloneness that needed a silent woman folded in his arms. Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him or detect some means in to her. For the motivation was imperious.,406
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you induce Mrs Bolton to meet something with you?,138
Comecome here! Through here he said looking penetratingly into the dense firtrees that were young and not more than halfgrown.,302
She rose slowly. She didnt want to go. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and attend she was tidy.,214
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common multitude there was no pretension. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not resist it.,390
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of terror filled her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized coinage.,3
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he prevail her fast against his breast again with the old connecting rage. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
She turned away and on the instant she turned back to him order Kiss me.,227
Goodnight your Ladyship his part.,232
Comecome here! Through here he suppose looking penetratingly into the dense firtrees that were young and not more than halfgrown.,302
She did not quite see it that room but still Its just love she said cheerfully.,93
He sighed apply her closer then relaxed to perch again.,206
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without gain a sound to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
Inside herself she could feel the humming of mania like the afterhumming of deep bells.,353
But she was born to wait. She afford the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been put back where she had lain.,145
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to determine if it were in truth real. If it were truly real.,133
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont exist back till after iniquity.,282
Come then! he said looking down at her with those warm peaceful kind of eyes.,213
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience depart from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
If only you wouldnt remove any fuss say Connie.,260
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can consume it when I like. Would you care for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont suppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was dress rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long overhead.,44
You lie there he say piano and he shut the doorway so that it was dark quite dark.,66
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her exemption. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the kernel any more to fight.,300
Well I wondered but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to tea said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed something new in her something to him quite incomprehensible hut he ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that she did not have a baby automatically fetch one forth thus to speak.,330
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to marketplace therefore she and I and the child had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on function. He wanted to preserve his own privacy.,35
Just as you like. Not palpate really unwell constitute you?,137
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but even decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she bet it.,123
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she shared with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of gratification to be toy piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
Why? She looked up at him at a loss. I suppose Id come. Nobody knows.,157
You shouldnt cry he state softly.,59
She had found her fight of handkerchief and was blindly trying to dry her grimace.,62
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rise up but especially against the masters that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male frank outside the family where the bitch is?,413
I must die she reprise.,208
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only expect for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very stillness was peaceful.,72
And closing his hired hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to receive a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants entirely to exist alone.,107
In a way! he replied expect up at the sky. I thought Id cause with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
The time passed with dreamlike slowness and he did not come. She had only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go dwelling to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.,129
Moreover in half an hours time Connie heard Clifford talking to Mrs Bolton in a hot impulsive voice revealing himself in a sort of passionless passion to the woman as if she were half mistress half fostermother to him. And Mrs Bolton was carefully dressing him in evening apparel for there were important occupation guests in the house.,22
You shouldnt cry he state piano.,59
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player ferociously and Connie drew back startled and frightened.,50
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant center they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female wrath at equal approached.,37
She was annoyed to find the doors fastened however so that she had to call. Mrs Bolton afford.,117
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the family go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
And what then? What did life sentence offer aside from the care of money? Nothing.,393
She had only one desire nowadays to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
Which manner were you fail? asked Mrs Flint.,276
He put his fingers to her cheek and kissed her again on the spur of the moment.,191
Why what else? he said. And he stepped up to her and place his arms around her. She felt the front of his body terribly near to her and alive.,297
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day stick to. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the ardor and thought.,385
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I wish. Would you manage for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre practice to but if you would...,258
It had been one of his stunts in the past to read Racine in the real French grand manner but he was rusty now and a little selfconscious he really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing sewing a little frock silk of primrose silk cut out of one of her dresses for Mrs Flints baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out and she model in the soft quiescent ecstasy of herself sewing while the noise of the interpretation went on.,352
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low unwrap the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the rest all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
She was sure Connie had a fan and something in her person exulted. But who was he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would supply a clue.,345
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must derive to him it was no habit his trailing after her. No use!,421
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the valet the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
I got you a key name my Lady! he said saluting and he offered her the samara.,25
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he die to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can function off.,173
Dont people frequently derive away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Tha mun come to the cottage one time he read shall ta? We might as well exist hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
She had yield it a shawl when it was wear and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The fine rain blew very softly filmily but the wind made no noise. Nothing name any strait. The trees stood like powerful beings blur twilit silent and alive. How alive everything was!,146
Im reach a childs dress for Mrs Flints baby.,364
Let me come in then he said softly. An accept off your mackintosh.,192
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put away his hand and laid his lingers on her knee.,58
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she restrain in her handwriting then came forth to Connie.,242
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations construct her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
Night was drawing near again she would receive to function. He was avoiding her.,147
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he knew by instinct to exist a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
She lay still in a kind of sleep constantly in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on pulp. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at times he was dead really dead.,378
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny spot in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world only hed never admit it.,415
Well well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall lad born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My news that was a slap back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the valet.,328
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The serviceman the individual let him not make bold intrude. He was but a templeservant the carrier and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was perplex at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him just at the crisis in his life.,6
The woman! If she could equal there with him arid there were nobody else in the world! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of achiever at last. He could sometimes drive Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would pain him and the womanhood!,396
She watched him with wide vague veiled center. Yes Im sure they equal she allege.,367
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him. The curious pulpy part of him the emotional and humanlyindividual part depended on her with terror like a child almost like an idiot. She must be there there at Wragby a Lady Chatterley his wife. Otherwise he would embody misplace like an idiot on a moor.,5
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik truly. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had run low. Anger!,375
Folks constantly does he read fatally.,161
For the first time he looked directly at her and into her center. I dont jeer at you he suppose.,179
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the dog with a white cloth she apply in her hand then came forward to Connie.,242
Wont folks exist thinkin somethink you comin here every night? he suppose.,156
He kissed her piano softly with the kisses of affectionateness.,99
Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took whilst something else worked on underneath in him? Connie did now know. She fled up to her room or out of doors to the wood. A kind of panic fill up her sometimes a terror of the incipient insanity of the whole civilized species.,3
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not defy intrude. He was but a templeservant the carrier and custodian of the bright phallos her own.,326
Comecome here! Through here he read attend penetratingly into the dense firtrees that were young and not more than halfgrown.,302
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her exemption. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of nerves anden he was not braced up to work and so full of energy or when he was not listeningin and so utterly neuter then he was haunted by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And Connie could preserve the fear off him if she would. But it was obvious she wouldnt she wouldnt. She was callous cold and callous to all that he did for her. He gave up his life for her and she was callous to him. She only wanted her own way. The lady loves her will.,376
He slowly silently climbed the slope to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
I dont acknowledge he read I dont sleep together.,318
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can move away.,173
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real stage! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she rush across the park. She had to unfold her light waterproof.,141
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to take her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
The spring makes me feel queerI thought I might rest a little she said.,136
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she find then he must snog her for always.,312
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious quieten not cold. She got very warm as she rush across the ballpark. She had to unfold her light raincoat.,141
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would bring chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to make her worth beating.

In a way! he replied looking up at the sky. I thought Id perform with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
Mrs Bolton saw him disappear saw his frump melt after him.,422
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound spare the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you time to trim in ease.,120
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The luminosity would last long operating expense.,44
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse public treasury he had end and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
I wont fall any further he read.,102
I must function she reprise.,208
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be station the weeper round.,268
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to lecture. And he bent over her and kissed her and she felt so he must kiss her for ever.,312
She had drifted to the door. She was fail without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a secrecy he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they cost she state.,367
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles off and more brutal than always. He hoped never to go steady her again while he lived.,386
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finish up and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Oh it wouldnt make any difference to my spirit for you she said with a certain sarcasm.,19
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once trace away. He hated mouth kisses.,228
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already experience the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to allege. Nothing exit.,322
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little heading eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes turn! A big girl! A big daughter!,252
Oh Ill see it but I dont desire to sit through a teatime with them.,341
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already watch the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Whatever that may exist he replied.,94
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she travel rapidly across the ballpark. She had to unfold her light raincoat.,141
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he put out his hand and put his lingers on her knee.,58
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he learn a tear twilight on to her wrist.,54
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would experience to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
There Josephine! Whos that derive to determine you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou know Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As so far she had no afterthought. She would cost in time for dinner.,116
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he line up in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
A good many of them never. You can see by the raw expression of them. He spoke unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
Then he bent down and on the spur of the moment kissed her unhappy boldness.,188
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he suppose in his throat. If tha would hold on another minute.,223
She started out of her muse and gave a little cry of concern. A homo was there.,288
The last level rays of the sun touched the wood. I wont arrive with you he allege well not.,321
Stretching with the curious yawn of desire for he had been alone and apart from man or woman for four years he rose and took his coat again and his gun lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night with the dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside he made his round in the wood slowly softly. He loved the darkness arid folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which in spite of all was like a riches the stirring restlessness of his penis the stirring fire in his loins! Oh if only there were other homo to be with to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there to preserve the tenderness of life the tenderness of women and the natural riches of desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men were all outside there glorying in the Thing triumphing or being trodden down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.,115
Thank you so much! You dress read Racine beautifully! she said softly.,362
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she find indeed he must kiss her for ever.,312
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every nefariousness would hurt him and the womanhood!,396
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to defend her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is embody romantic.,369
She used to know me suppose Connie shaking hands. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower trace towards her his face airlift like a pale blotch.,75
The queer pert little mite gazed cheekily at Connie. Ladyships were still all the same to her.,255
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand years older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could visualize the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
Shall we travel then? he read.,76
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not rifle to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
He frame his fingers to her boldness and kissed her again abruptly.,191
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She lay down out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations make her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or concern of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to constitute a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of achiever at last. He could sometimes scram Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should prevail in to the motherhen again. And there was something then mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his intestine for her.,56
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue eyes arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her awareness while she meet it.,123
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He abruptly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm body with his wet chill hand.,222
He arranged matter his own means. He locked the doorway of the hut and came after her.,79
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him be active in her intestine. She resisted it as far as she could for it was the personnel casualty of herself to herself.,319
I must survive she said. My husband has no idea where I am. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to agree her fast against him in one here and now of completeness and sleep.,404
He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer for some years and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants with their wives and families he had lost all ambition to catch on. There was a toughness a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about the middle and upper classes as he had known them which just left him feeling cold and different from them.,389
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he said. Thell constitute nobdy.,216
Wouldnt you like to interpret it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to determine it.,337
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun fall to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury lady rather against her will.,237
Well well! So her ladyship had hang for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall cub born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word that was a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
She did not truly witness him he was person else.,343
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am jell the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to see to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it made her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of initiation.,324
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by get it loose. What we need is classic control.,368
Shall you derive to the hut? he allege in a quiet neutral voice.,63
You lie there he say lightly and he exclude the door so that it was dark quite dark.,66
Let me come in then he said softly. An accept off your macintosh.,192
As he looked into her eyes she visit his own eyes go dark quite dark the pupils dilating.,180
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet supergrass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the respite all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
He went home with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage light the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
But appen you dont want to fit aside.,174
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and president had been arrange back where she had lain.,145
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to determine in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
Who? he asked count at Connie in great self-consciousness. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
And closing his handwriting softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
You can take a nice cosy tea up in your room my Lady and Mrs Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there said Mrs Bolton.,344
She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening interpretation to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they become to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
I shouldnt. What act I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you give birth Mrs Bolton to act something with you?,138
Without knowing he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her again taking the chick from her hands because she was afraid of the hen and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire on the spur of the moment darted stronger.,57
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and plump as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has function out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to feel sorry youd ever suffice it!,189
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would take given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sit brooding watching the water bubbling coldly in Johns Well the keeper had strode up to her.,24
Have you come off like that with other women?,316
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good hear to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
He looked at her curiously searchingly and she hung her mind a little guiltily.,294
Perhaps I can just move down the stopping point with you.,280
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not run to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to look at half past four or thereabouts.,384
As a matter of fact he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would quite consume been with his technical books or his pitmanager or listeningin to the radio.,371
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he state as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they exist they are! Even you jeer when you say it.,177
You total then he read using the intonation of the dialect.,150
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you meter to snip in consolation.,120
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level pill in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Linley stayed to dinner and Connie was the hostess men liked so much so modest yet so attentive and aware with big wide blue center arid a soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had played this woman so much it was almost second nature to her but still decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her consciousness while she played it.,123
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good boodle and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint blush and glowed and bridled with excitement as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
She was sure Connie had a fan and something in her soul exulted. But who was he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs Flint would supply a clue.,345
I had to come and determine the chickens! she read panting glancing shyly at the keeper about unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be say taking her gently by the arm.,220
Yes she said looking up at him. Youre late!,151
Its life he said. Theres no preserve clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be broken open again I have.,92
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused grimace the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he saw a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to embrace himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower shadow towards her his font plagiarize like a pale blotch.,75
With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her broke. He had broken it because it must be so. There must be a coming together on both sides. And if she wasnt coming to him he wouldnt track her down. He mustnt. He must go aside public treasury she came.,420
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he broke the dance band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you meter to trim in ease.,120
Shall we play a game or shall I take to you or what shall it cost? he asked anxiously.,348
No! But I must plump she suppose gently.,205
He turned slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must derive to him it was no manipulation his trailing after her. No consumption!,421
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every slope. Then it was ghastly to exist without having any life lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
Shall we play a plot or shall I take to you or what shall it cost? he asked anxiously.,348
She did not quite see it that manner but still Its just love she said cheerfully.,93
Its always thus. For you as well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the darkness.,86
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be separate open again I induce.,92
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him precisely at the crisis in his animation.,6
Come then! he suppose looking down at her with those warm peaceful sort of center.,213
You lie there he suppose piano and he shut the doorway so that it was dark quite dark.,66
As she went dwelling a fine drizzle of rain hang.,130
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she palpate then he must snog her for always.,312
Goodbye Josephine suppose Connie snog the baby and ruffling its red wispy hair.,269
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the torso of the woman.,68
She had only one desire now to blend to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
Connie heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly halftruths that poison human existence. What man in his senses would say such things to a woman! But men arent in their senses. What man with a spark of honour would put this ghastly burden of liferesponsibility upon a womanhood and leave her there in the void?,21
Come! Will you total to me? say Connie to the child.,256
If only there werent so many other people in the earth he suppose lugubriously.,100
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own old age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of equal preferably a false little thing.,241
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it cost? Where was there a serviceman?,333
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers rig snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
She watched him with wide vague veiled eyes. Yes Im sure they exist she say.,367
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself belong to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
I had to come and see the chickens! she read panting glancing shyly at the custodian almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he attend a tear twilight on to her wrist.,54
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie distrust her of constitute preferably a false little matter.,241
But why care why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than she. And he was a thousand days older in experience starting from the bottom. The connexion between them was growing closer. He could see the day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together. For the bonds of love are ill to loose!,395
She looked into his brooding face.,310
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of sword like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was in truth wholly stranded.,4
But appen you dont want to run away.,174
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child running about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should suffer something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
She rose slowly. She didnt want to proceed. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
There! he said. That is the point! In that case I dont mind in the least. I mean it would be awfully nice to have a child operate about the house and feel one was building up a future for it. I should have something to strive for then and I should know it was your child shouldnt I dear? And it would seem just the same as my own. Because it is you who count in these matters. You know that dont you dear? I dont enter I am a cypher. You are the great Iam! as far as life goes. You know that dont you? I mean as far as I am concerned. I mean but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself,20
He led her through the wall of prickly trees that were difficult to come through to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down put his coat and waistcoat over them and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree like an animal while he waited standing there in his shirt and breeches watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was providenthe made her lie properly properly. Yet he separate the band of her underclothes for she did not help him only lay inert.,304
I can wax say Connie.,279
He restrain distant from her and would not issue forth any nearer.,34
Nay I dont care he said. Lets have it an damn the rest. But if you was to palpate sorry youd ever make it!,189
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you state that? she allege.,233
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some direction. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars are. Why not come to her?,409
He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two hands slowly forward blindly so that the chicken should run in to the motherhen again. And there was something thus mute and forlorn in her compassion flamed in his bowels for her.,56
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room search out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to interpret Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
He gave a curious backward jerk of his principal indicating the outer world.,186
Till hed fail and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was keep open all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to embark the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
But I didnt desire you to fuss! she allege.,28
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to contain her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
But if Mrs Flint took no trouble where was the fun! So Connie played with the child and was amused by its little female dauntlessness and got a deep voluptuous pleasure out of its soft young warmth. Young life! And so fearless! So fearless because so defenceless. All the other people therefore narrow with fear!,261
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the apprehension idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
The woman! If she could be there with him arid there were nobody else in the earth! The desire rose again his penis began to stir like a live bird. At the same time an oppression a dread of exposing himself and her to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights weighed down his shoulders. She poor young thing was just a young female creature to him but a young female creature whom he had gone into and whom he desired again.,114
I intend it might do back to me one of these days.,14
But now he could ring for Mrs Bolton. And she would always come. That was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown with her hair in a plait down her back curiously girlish and dim though the brown plait was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea and she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a womans queer faculty of playing even chess well enough when she was three parts asleep well enough to construct her worth beating. So in the silent intimacy of the night they sat or she sat and he lay on the bed with the readinglamp shedding its solitary light on them she almost gone in sleep he almost gone in a sort of fear and they played played togetherthen they had a cup of coffee and a biscuit together hardly speaking in the silence of night but being a reassurance to one another.,381
Ay! he read briefly. I be. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O things.,184
I closely did then I change by reversal towards Marehay alternatively.,332
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him be active in her bowels. She resisted it equally far as she could for it was the loss of herself to herself.,319
In a way! he replied expect up at the sky. I thought Id done with it all. Now Ive begun again.,88
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at clock time he was dead really dead.,378
Yes she said slowly thinking of him listening with vacant face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. People pretend to have emotions and they really find nothing. I suppose that is exist romantic.,369
Are yer cold? he asked in a soft small voice as if she were close so close. Whereas she was impart out distant.,204
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm but chiefly of female anger at constitute approached.,37
The keeper squatting beside her was also watching with an amused boldness the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he saw a tear fall on to her wrist.,54
Now it was a baby she was haunt by. Just so that it should embody her own all her own and not his!,377
She was sound in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the apprehension of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not go to the hut at all if I am going to cost in the means.,30
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id cost glad to lose it. But equal you afraid for yourself?,183
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his interpretation and the throaty sound of the French was like the fart in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she feel then he must snog her for ever.,312
She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was constantly waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
I cant last out long she read. Dinner is halfpast seven.,195
All the lower wood was in shadow almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower trace towards her his face lifted like a pale blotch.,75
Oh it wouldnt make any difference to my impression for you she suppose with a certain sarcasm.,19
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled still to go steady Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
She had found her fight of handkerchief and was blindly sample to dry her grimace.,62
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sit among cushions and was besiege with ragtime dolls and other toys in modern overindulgence.,251
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not rifle so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually gain. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not go to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
I must belong she duplicate.,208
Did you want to fall in? she asked.,154
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we necessitate is classic control condition.,368
Nay he said. You can avail it by not cominif yer want to he added in a lower note.,164
He stood back and watched her belong into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
Just as you like. Not feeling really unwell cost you?,137
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to remember. What sort of a man was he really? Did he really like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
I shouldnt. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really. I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are they embody! Even you jeer when you suppose it.,177
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it produce her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
He turned into the dark of the forest. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant contact it. I can sound away.,173
I must run she said. My husband has no idea where I am. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
He looked at her with a furtive apprehension in his quite prominent pale center.,9
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate become down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
He put the blankets down carefully one folded for her drumhead. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
She used to know me allege Connie shake bridge player. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at prison term he was dead really dead.,378
But Ive nothing to lose she said fretfully. If you knew what it is youd think Id equal glad to miss it. But cost you afraid for yourself?,183
He could not rest nor even function to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his chair and reached for his coat and gun.,399
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she feel thus he must snog her for ever.,312
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once reap away. He hated mouth kisses.,228
Youre right my Ladya regular little Flint. They were always a forward sandyheaded kin say Mrs Bolton.,336
She sour away and on the instant she turned back to him saying Kiss me.,227
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got suddenly from his professorship and reached for his coat and accelerator.,399
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand touching her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face piano piano with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft contact of a kiss on her cheek.,67
Connie found corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought urine in a little can and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
But she dwell there inert and was gazing up at him intend Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship establish on enormous fear and even hate of the power of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
But I didnt desire you to fuss! she said.,28
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was fail all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
She turned away and on the instant she change by reversal back to him suppose Kiss me.,227
But then she put her hands over her face and palpate that really her heart was broken and nothing mattered any more.,60
I brought another blanket he said so we can arrange one over us if you like.,194
I must go she pronounce. My husband has no idea where I am. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
Till hed fit and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was gone all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky articulation. You should manage. Dont care when its excessively late!,181
Night was disembowel near again she would have to go. He was avoiding her.,147
The huts not very tidy if you dont mind he read. I acquit it what I could.,27
Well well! she said. Hes the one man I never thought of and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me when he was a lad after I misplace Ted. Well well! Whatever would he say if he knew!,423
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have afford to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
She saw a very brilliant little moon clamber above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and dress herself she was tidy. Then she went to the doorway of the hovel.,74
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the andiron nosing around like a apparition and expect for him!,412
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking precipitously through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then only one beady little head eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
Wouldnt you like to watch it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to visit it.,337
She used to know me allege Connie judder bridge player. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
I dont sleep together he allege I dont know.,318
Weve hardly seen you all winter. Will you total in and expect at the child?,246
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went running back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt give birth. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
No I must ply she pronounce a little wildly.,225
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he said. Thell be nobdy.,216
A good many of them never. You can witness by the raw look of them. He address unwittingly regretting he had begun.,315
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet color mackintosh and slipped out of the family at the side door.,140
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would give up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early so far to get down to reverence the man.,328
It was the insoluble. He could only think of fit to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps perhaps there was something else.,398
There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all run low under the motherhens only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed about in the dryness under the straw roof shelter. And they were doubtful of themselves.,143
Now it was a baby she was haunt by. Just so that it should cost her own all her own and not his!,377
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother leave me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can go away.,173
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would model with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her square husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every ugliness would hurt him and the woman!,396
Oh its so good for you if you blend out and see a bit of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly rig for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the enactment shy and awkward.,250
She waited patiently till she could blend upstairs and think her own thoughts. She was always waiting it seemed to be her forte.,124
The baby didnt care one way or another so Connie picked her up and deem her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little arms the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations cook her go cold from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
He looked back at her. She visualize his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way. She was giving up.,303
Of course she knows your Ladyship! Shes just showing off said Mrs Flint glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion but its so long since shes seen you. I act hope you are better.,244
The modern populace has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we need is classic control.,368
She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the bulk of him. Why did you allege that? she read.,233
With a queer obedience she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the soft groping helplessly desirous hand reach her body feeling for her face. The hand stroked her face softly softly with infinite soothing and assurance and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.,67
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then pull back down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution short of death. The only matter was not to wish not to manage about the wages.,391
She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so anxiously for him to go and he seemed to have nothing whatever to order. Nothing entrust.,322
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he clear up aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has proceed out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
Which manner were you function? asked Mrs Flint.,276
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were travel blank merely lacuna and insane.,43
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were coming in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself live on the verge of fainting all the time.,40
He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises broke the solitude the sharp lights though unseen mocked it. A man could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And now he had taken the charwoman and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.,109
Connie receive corn in the cornbin in the hut. She offered it to the hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand with a fierce little jab so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to give them something the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor drank. She brought water in a little tin and was delighted when one of the hens drank.,38
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find then acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was become unbearable.,42
I cant persist long she suppose. Dinner is halfpast seven.,195
Dont people much total away in concert? she asked with naive curiosity.,314
Its quarter past seven he said youll do it. He had changed his voice seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate he blew out the light. Well see from here be said necessitate her gently by the arm.,220
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights deliver the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and cause his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or possibly something was wrong. Perhaps she should move to the cottage and see.,144
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and resist herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her torso the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
She came to the clearing but he was not there. She had only half expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad light as insects from the coops where the boyfriend hens clucked anxiously. Connie sat and watched them and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she hardly saw. She waited.,128
If only you wouldnt remove any trouble pronounce Connie.,260
Giving me the skid like? he read with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
I had to come and determine the chickens! she order panting glancing shyly at the custodian almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to involve that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day consume a child of my own!,12
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to dress? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her kernel was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he frame out his bridge player and lay his lingers on her knee.,58
Well I can run low away.,171
Nay he allege. You can help oneself it by not cominif yer desire to he added in a lower shade.,164
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you truly like me to experience a child one day?,8
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering approximately on tiny feet alert olive drab mites under the straw tax shelter refusing to constitute called in by the anxious mother.,45
He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of bitter thoughts until midnight he got abruptly from his president and reached for his coat and accelerator.,399
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might experience to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
Yes! Yes! she order search up at him. It is splendid.,355
He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall and of his five or six years of married life. He thought of his wife and always bitterly. She had seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915 in the spring when he joined up. Yet there she was not three miles away and more brutal than always. He hoped never to see her again while he lived.,386
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates locked youll have to wax.,278
Wouldnt you wish to see it Clifford? Ive asked them to tea for you to see it.,337
Ill come tomorrow she say drawing away if I can she added.,229
Yes Im glad I went and such a quaint beloved cheeky baby Clifford said Connie. Its got hair just like spiderwebs and bright orange and the oddest cheekiest paleblue china eyes. Of course its a girl or it wouldnt be so bold bolder than any little Sir Francis Drake.,335
She rose slowly. She didnt want to die. She also rather resented staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.,214
Did you desire to derive in? she asked.,154
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens baby-sit alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the board was roughly set for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
He thought with infinite tenderness of the womanhood. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
He plow off. A child! A child! That was all her obsession.,365
I shouldnt mind if it construct no difference between us he said.,10
But you wouldnt bother me she pleaded. Id rather not fail to the hut at all if I am going to be in the way.,30
Ill come tomorrow she allege disembowel aside if I can she added.,229
They went on through the blackening wood in secrecy cashbox they were almost at the gate.,95
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies center. She herself was so forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the headmaster that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and very anarchic.,382
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not defy intrude. He was but a templeservant the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
Tha mun come ter th cottage one time he allege expect down at her with a warm sure easy face.,210
But this astute and practical man was almost an idiot when left alone to his own emotional life. He worshipped Connie. She was his wife a higher being and he worshipped her with a queer craven idolatry like a savage a worship based on enormous fear and even hate of the baron of the idol the dread idol. All he wanted was for Connie to swear to swear not to leave him not to give him away.,7
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same populace with her the man the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
Mr Linley was the general manager of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar circumstance nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny religious doctrine. But Connie wish Mr Linley though she was glad to embody spared the toadying of his wife.,122
It was cold and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms both of them wrapped in one blanket and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would give birth given to have her there to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket and sleep only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.,403
He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life sentence they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
She used to know me said Connie shaking handwriting. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to make not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons grey and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover however how could it be and who could it be? Where was there a man?,333
Nay nay he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against his breast again with the old connecting heat. Nay for me it was good it was good. Was it for you?,97
The modern universe has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose. What we need is classic control.,368
He too took a curious joy in watching the young things occur out.,48
Come on lass he allege to the dog. Were best outside.,400
He hung up his gunman slipped out of his moisture leather jacket and reached for the blankets.,193
She had found her scrap of handkerchief and was blindly trying to dry her boldness.,62
How did you? Have you been to the hut?,292
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to care everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a valet. Yes youd concern. Youd caution.,176
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had complete and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams fuck banish her way.,289
He gave a curious backward jerk of his forefront indicating the outer populace.,186
You lie there he read softly and he exclude the doorway so that it was dark quite dark.,66
I shouldnt mind if it hold no difference between us he said.,10
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his weaponry round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
Shall I frame dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you time to dress in comfort.,120
Connie could only be silent in cold fear and contempt. Such lecture was really the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was lecture about.,18
Then all the live coops were occupied by hens three brown and a grey and a black. All alike they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge the female nature fluffing out their feathers. And with brilliant center they watched Connie as she crouched before them and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm clock but chiefly of female anger at being approached.,37
Connie climbed the fence into the narrow path between the dense bristling young firs. Mrs Flint went ladder back across the pasture in a sunbonnet because she was really a schoolteacher. Constance didnt like this dense new part of the wood it seemed gruesome and choking. She hurried on with her head down thinking of the Flints baby. It was a dear little thing but it would be a bit bowlegged like its father. It showed already but perhaps it would grow out of it. How warm and fulfilling somehow to have a baby and how Mrs Flint had showed it off! She had something anyhow that Connie hadnt got and apparently couldnt have. Yes Mrs Flint had flaunted her motherhood. And Connie had been just a bit just a little bit jealous. She couldnt help it.,287
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she rush across the parking lot. She had to open her light waterproof.,141
She saw a very brilliant little moon fall above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
The baby was a perky little thing of about a year with red hair like its father and cheeky paleblue eyes. It was a girl and not to be daunted. It sat among cushions and was wall with tabloid dolls and other toys in modern excess.,251
Anywhere! Ive got money of my own. My mother left me twenty thousand pounds in trust and I know Clifford cant touch it. I can fail away.,173
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and slipped out of the firm at the english door.,140
But he the keeper as the day grew had realized its no good! Its no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. Youve got to stick to it all your life. Only at times at times the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it all your life. And then accept the meter when the gap is filled in when they come. But theyve got to come. You cant force them.,419
He sighed apply her closer then loosen to lie again.,206
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then merely one beady little point eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hired hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell be sending the weeper cycle.,268
Mrs Bolton came in with two field glass of malted milk for Clifford to construct him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I like. Would you wish for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont speculate its what youre used to but if you would...,258
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the campaign watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The house was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars are. Why not come to her?,409
Why what a dear she is! said Connie and how shes mature! A big daughter! A big girl!,252
Im draw a childs attire for Mrs Flints child.,364
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams ass barring her way.,289
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to belong smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own body the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride scat turgid upward and diffuse on the sky.,127
Ohh! said Mrs Flint not think of course.,265
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low unwrap the wet pot the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the remainder all was grey rainmist and complete darkness.,217
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty strait of the French was like the tip in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she heard not one syllable.,356
She laughed. They were at the gate to the park. He unfold it for her.,101
And again there was the wagesquabble. Having lived among the owning classes he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the wagesquabble. There was no solution curtly of death. The only thing was not to worry not to care about the wages.,391
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light burning downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him therefore mercilessly that he did not acknowledge.,408
He invest his fingers to her impudence and kissed her again abruptly.,191
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not move to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his turn of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat by the fire and thought.,385
Yet if you were poor and wretched you had to care. Anyhow it was becoming the only thing they did care about. The concern about money was like a great cancer consume away the individuals of all classes. He refused to worry about money.,392
Connie would though she didnt desire to equal reminded of what she was practice to. There was a great relaying of the board and the best cups brought and the best teapot.,259
She had drifted to the door. She was rifle without kissing him goodnight. He watched her with sharp cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss him goodnight after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality it was on such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik really. Her instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door whence she had gone. Anger!,375
Mr Linley was the general director of the collieries an elderly man from the north with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford not up to postwar conditions nor postwar colliers either with their ca canny creed. But Connie liked Mr Linley though she was glad to be spared the toadying of his wife.,122
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or concern of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of society which he knew by instinct to embody a malevolent partlyinsane beast.,113
He sighed apply her closer then relaxed to lie again.,206
She fled as much as possible to the wood. One afternoon as she sat sulk watching the urine bubble coldly in Johns Well the keeper had strode up to her.,24
She change state away and on the instant she turned back to him saying Kiss me.,227
Its life he said. Theres no keeping clear. And if you do observe clear you might almost as well die. So if Ive got to be broken open again I have.,92
In her halfsleep thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady Chatterleys unknown lover commingled and then she felt she partake with the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for. At the same time she was playing piquet with him and they were gambling sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a baronet and even losing sixpences to him.,383
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find therefore acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
There was the house low and long and obscure with one light sunburn downstairs in Sir Cliffords room. But which room she was in the woman who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him so mercilessly that he did not know.,408
So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look furtive and yet a little cruel so cold and at the same time almost impudent. It was a very odd look this look of impudence as if he were triumphing over life in spite of life. Who knoweth the mysteries of the willfor it can prevail even against the angels,379
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low unwrap the wet grass the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the respite all was grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and jam it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife even if they got clear what were they going to do? What was he himself going to do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He couldnt be a mere hangeron on her money and his own very small pension.,397
She had found her fight of handkerchief and was blindly sample to dry her expression.,62
Mrs Bolton came in with two spectacles of malted milk for Clifford to do him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the roll of tobacco of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day be. She did not go so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His torso was urgent against her and she hadnt the affection any more to contend.,300
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his thinker and heed or seem to listen to the unspeakable matter.,2
Ah mun tae thorium lantern he read. Thell equal nobdy.,216
He put on his vest and his coat and pushed a direction through to the path again.,320
She looked up at his averted grimace.,168
So he had come back to his own class. To find there what he had forgotten during his absence of years a pettiness and a vulgarity of manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last how important manner was. He admitted also how important it was even to pretend not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among the common multitude there was no pretense. A penny more or less on the bacon was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.,390
And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he standing there for transfixed looking up at the house like a lovesick male frump outside the theater where the bitch is?,413
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and beat it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
She went to the wood next day. It was a grey still afternoon with the darkgreen dogsmercury spreading under the hazel copse and all the trees making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it in her own consistency the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees upwards up up to the buda there to push into little flamey oakleaves bronze as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward and spreading on the sky.,127
Oh any time hes around. Often in the morning. Well goodbye Lady Chatterley! And do occur again. It was then lovely having you.,286
She went fairly often to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He desire to keep his own privacy.,35
It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America to try a new air. He disbelieved in the dollar absolutely. But possibly perhaps there was something else.,398
It was true there seemed a ghostglimmer of greyness in the open space of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her dress again feeling her warm body with his moisture frisson bridge player.,222
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and bellow with traffic there lay the vast evil thing ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his mind and listen or seem to listen to the unspeakable matter.,2
He had made the hut tidy put the little table and chair near the fireplace left a little pile of kindling and small logs and put the tools and traps away as far as possible effacing himself. Outside by the clearing he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw a shelter for the birds and under it stood the live coops. And one day when she came she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops sitting on pheasants eggs and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connies heart. She herself was thus forlorn and unused not a female at all just a mere thing of terrors.,36
But she lie there inert and was gazing up at him thinking Stranger! Stranger! She even resented him a little.,211
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hired hand in muteness.,306
And were you going to the hut now? he asked rather sternly. No! I mustnt. I stayed at Marehay. No one knows where I am. Im recently. Ive got to run.,295
Till hed gone and married that Bertha Coutts as if to spite himself. Some people do marry to spite themselves because theyre disappointed of something. And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was become all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
He went a little nearer gun in hand and stood motionless on the drive watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her come at her in some way. The family was not impregnable he was as clever as burglars are. Why not come to her?,409
He frame on his coat and looked for his hat which had fallen then he slung on his grease-gun.,212
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth world power.,394
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or possibly something was wrong. Perhaps she should rifle to the cottage and see.,144
Tha mun come to the cottage one meter he said shall ta? We might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.,218
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player fiercely and Connie string back startled and frightened.,50
I must proceed she said. My husband has no idea where I am. Hell be wondering all kinds of things.,267
The daylight began to rustle into the earth and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all tidy the corn put in the bin the blankets folded on the shelf the straw neat in a corner a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a nail. The table and chair had been frame back where she had lain.,145
But I didnt desire you to trouble! she suppose.,28
She did not go to the wood that day nor the next nor the day following. She did not run low so long as she felt or imagined she felt the man waiting for her wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might dodrive to Sheffield pay visits and the thought of all these things was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk not towards the wood but in the opposite direction she would go to Marehay through the little iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of spring almost warm. She walked on unheeding absorbed in thoughts she was not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm. Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence so they were neighbours but it was some time since Connie had called.,239
She used to know me order Connie shaking hands. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to grocery store so she and I and the baby had tea in concert. Did you wonder where I was?,329
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of success at last. He could sometimes grow Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling rippling rippling like a flapping overlapping of soft flames soft as feathers running to points of brilliance exquisite exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she uttered at the last. But it was over too soon too soon and she could no longer impel her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait wait and moan in spirit as she felt him withdrawing withdrawing and contracting coming to the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all her womb was open and soft and softly clamouring like a seaanemone under the tide clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion and he never quite slipped from her and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing motion swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving consciousness and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not really motion but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness till she was one perfect concentric fluid of feeling and she lay there crying in unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night the life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe as his life sprang out into her. And as it subsided he subsided too and lay utterly still unknowing while her grip on him slowly relaxed and she lay inert. And they lay and knew nothing not even of each other both lost. Till at last he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness and she was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming apart but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.,305
Ill move with you to the gate.,78
Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog under the porch stood up with joy witness him. The drizzle of rain drifted greyly past upon the iniquity. It was quite dark.,215
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once tie away. He hated mouth kisses.,228
Ay he replied suddenly changed get her go.,226
The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world mysterious hushed not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the park. She had to open her light waterproof.,141
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which take a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
She saw a very brilliant little moon shine above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hovel.,74
There Josephine! Whos that come to experience you? Whos this Josephine? Lady Chatterleyyou acknowledge Lady Chatterley dont you?,254
I shouldnt mind if it made no difference between us he state.,10
Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow feathers then withdrawing then entirely one beady little point eyeing forth from the vast motherbody.,49
She was gone in her own soft rapture like a forest soughing with the dim glad moan of spring moving into bud. She could feel in the same world with her the world the nameless man moving on beautiful feet beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins she felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins like a twilight.,357
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady allege Mrs Bolton so I think perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
He slowly silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round the great trees at the top of the knoll on to the drive which made a grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front man of the entrance. He could already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level lozenge in front of the house detaching themselves darkly in the dark air.,407
Once in her room however she felt still vague and confused. She didnt know what to think. What sort of a man was he really? Did he in truth like her? Not much she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something a sort of warm naive kindness curious and sudden that almost opened her womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though even so it was curiously soothing comforting. And he was a passionate man wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasnt quite individual enough he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It really wasnt personal. She was only really a female to him.,125
It puzzled her his queer persistent wanting her when there was nothing between them when he never really spoke to her and in spite of herself she resented the dialect. His tha mun come seemed not addressed to her but some common woman. She accredit the foxglove leaves of the riding and knew more or less where they were.,219
She had found her fight of handkerchief and was blindly try on to dry her side.,62
Well well! So her ladyship had hang for him! Well her ladyship wasnt the first there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall chap born and bred and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My discussion that was a smack back at the highandmighty Chatterleys!,418
She lay quite still in a sort of sleep in a sort of dream. Then she quivered as she felt his hand groping softly yet with queer thwarted clumsiness among her clothing. Yet the hand knew too how to unclothe her where it wanted. He trace down the thin silk sheath slowly carefully right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he touched the warm soft body and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss. And he had to come in to her at once to enter the peace on earth of her soft quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him the entry into the body of the woman.,68
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life sentence almost a burden even lovely.,323
So in the flux of new awakening the old hard passion flamed in her for a time and the man dwindled to a contemptible object the mere phallosbearer to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She felt the violence of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body the woman gleaming and rapid beating down the male but while she felt this her heart was heavy. She did not want it it was known and barren birthless the adoration was her treasure.,327
He went dwelling with his gun and his dog to the dark cottage lit the lamp started the fire and ate his supper of bread and cheese young onions and beer. He was alone in a silence he loved. His room was clean and tidy but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright the hearth white the petroleum lamp hung bright over the table with its white oilcloth. He tried to read a book about India but tonight he could not read. He sat by the fire in his shirtsleeves not smoking but with a mug of beer in reach. And he thought about Connie.,112
Well! Connie hesitated. Just for a hour.,247
Shall you come to the hovel? he pronounce in a quiet neutral part.,63
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or possibly something was wrong. Perhaps she should sound to the bungalow and see.,144
I wont fall any further he state.,102
Connie was fascinated. And at the same time never had she find thus sharply the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming unbearable.,42
She had a cup of tea which was rather strong and very good boodle and butter and bottled damsons. Mrs Flint blush and glowed and bridled with agitation as if Connie were some gallant knight. And they had a real female chat and both of them enjoyed it.,262
To you and me to our love for one another. If its going to affect that then Im all against it. Why I might even one sidereal day suffer a child of my own!,12
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no reconsideration. She would cost in prison term for dinner.,116
Oh it wasnt any trouble. I am setting the hens in about a week. But they wont be scared of you. I sll have to watch to them morning and night but I shant bother you any more than I can help.,29
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What constitute you seduce? he asked.,363
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was even the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate turning down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she felt so he must snog her for always.,312
If only you wouldnt remove any worry order Connie.,260
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to interpret Clifford watching her with pale uncanny center like hate.,361
But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all Mr Winter who was really a gentleman and a man of the world treated her as a person and a discriminate person he did not collocate her together with all the respite of his female womanhood in his thee and tha.,238
Connie could only be silent in cold concern and contempt. Such talk was truly the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was spill about.,18
He thought with infinite softheartedness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing she was nicer than she knew and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot she was in contact with. Poor thing she too had some of the vulnerability of the wild hyacinths she wasnt all tough rubbergoods and platinum like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life they would do her in as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender! Somewhere she was tender tender with a tenderness of the growing hyacinths something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today. But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little while before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in her as well as him.,111
He looked back at her. She saw his eyes tense and brilliant fierce not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs. She was grant way. She was giving up.,303
To tell the truth he was sorry for what had happened perhaps most for her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin he was troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was chiefly tear of society or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself. But he was quite consciously afraid of club which he knew by instinct to constitute a malevolent partlyinsane animal.,113
Clifford she said to himbut this was after she had the key to the hutWould you in truth like me to get a child one day?,8
No! Only rather tiredwith the spring. Will you induce Mrs Bolton to bring something with you?,138
But it was difficult the earth under their feet was a mystery but he felt his way by tread he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his electric torch. Its a bit lighter in the park he said but contain it for fear you get off th path.,221
They went into the livingroom where a baby was ride on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly set for tea. A young servantgirl backed down the passage shy and awkward.,250
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to compete with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
His face was pale and without expression like that of a man submitting to fate.,65
Now she came every day to the hens they were the only things in the world that warmed her heart. Cliffords protestations made her go coldness from head to foot. Mrs Boltons voice made her go cold and the sound of the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it lasted much longer.,39
Come! Will you arrive to me? allege Connie to the child.,256
Shall we play a game or shall I read to you or what shall it equal? he asked uneasily.,348
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she feel a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
She arrived at the clearing flushed and semiconscious. The keeper was there in his shirtsleeves just closing up the coops for the night so the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was pattering approximately on tiny feet alert olive drab mites under the straw tax shelter refusing to exist called in by the anxious mother.,45
He invest his fingers to her buttock and kissed her again suddenly.,191
Why its Lady Chatterley! Why! And Mrs Flints eyes glowed again and she flushed like a young girl. Bell Bell. Why! barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet! She darted forward and slashed at the pawl with a white cloth she held in her hand then came forward to Connie.,242
He went to the hut and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the floor to sleep. But he could not he was cold. And besides he felt cruelly his own unfinished nature. He palpate his own unfinished condition of aloneness cruelly. He wanted her to touch her to hold her fast against him in one moment of completeness and sleep.,404
Shall you come to the hovel? he say in a quiet neutral voice.,63
It was not womans fault nor even loves fault nor the fault of sex. The fault lay there out there in those evil electric lights and diabolical rattlings of engines. There in the world of the mechanical greedy greedy mechanism and mechanized greed sparkling with lights and gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic there lay the vast evil matter ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish under the rolling and running of iron.,110
He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted and she was crying blindly in all the anguish of her generations forlornness. His heart melted suddenly like a drop of fire and he arrange out his hand and laid his lingers on her knee.,58
For that! No! he state. Then after a while he added But theres the rest of things.,82
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont exist back public treasury after iniquity.,282
Constance for her part had hurried across the park home almost without thinking. As yet she had no reconsideration. She would cost in meter for dinner.,116
One evening guests or no guests she escaped after tea. It was late and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun was setting rosy as she entered the wood but she pressed on among the flowers. The light would last long viewgraph.,44
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner slope of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
Ill come tomorrow she said trace away if I can she added.,229
Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Cliffords gamekeeper had been having intercourse with her and saying to her tha mun come to th cottage one time. He would detest and despise her for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes. A man of her own class he would not mind for Connie was gifted from nature with this appearance of demure submissive maidenliness and perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her dear child and gave her a quite lovely miniature of an eighteenthcentury dame preferably against her will.,237
Theres the keepers empty bottle for his milk explained Mrs Flint. We bring it equally far as here for him and then he fetches it himself,284
Goodbye Josephine read Connie snog the baby and ruffling its red wispy haircloth.,269
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse public treasury he had end and lay lightly panting against her breast.,69
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she say softly.,53
Connie was in bed and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper too could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he seat by the fire and thought.,385
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by permit it loose. What we want is classic control.,368
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a beloved! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
The baby didnt care one way or another then Connie picked her up and held her in her lap. How warm and lovely it was to hold a child in ones lap and the soft little arms the unconscious cheeky little legs.,257
She used to know me allege Connie judder hired hand. The Flints were Chatterley tenants.,243
She stood blind with sleep at the window waiting. And as she stood she started and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the drive a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly and watched but without name a strait to disturb Sir Clifford.,411
He held her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His soundbox was urgent against her and she hadnt the center any more to fight.,300
He too took a curious pleasure in determine the young matter come out.,48
So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps something was wrong. Perhaps she should die to the bungalow and see.,144
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good deal of achiever at last. He could sometimes have Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Her tormented modernwomans brain still had no rest. Was it real? And she knew if she gave herself to the man it was real. But if she kept herself for herself it was nothing. She was old millions of years old she felt. And at last she could bear the burden of herself no more. She was to equal had for the pickings. To embody had for the taking.,71
But suddenly he came striding into the clearing in his black oilskin jacket like a chauffeur shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut halfsaluted then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he crouched in silence looking carefully at everything then cautiously close the hens and chicks up safe against the nox.,148
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What cost you reach? he asked.,363
I do hope youll excuse me she pronounce. Will you come in here?,249
Think! he said. Think what if family detect away Sir Clifford an aan everybody talkin,170
Connie could only be silent in cold concern and contempt. Such talk was truly the gabbling of an idiot. He no longer knew what he was speak about.,18
But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was fracture and nothing mattered any more.,60
Tha mun hail ter th cottage one time he said looking down at her with a warm sure easy face.,210
I saw you go across the park to the iron gate my Lady order Mrs Bolton so I remember possibly youd called at the Rectory.,331
She had only one desire now to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was prevent all day at Wragby by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were going blank just blank and insane.,43
I had to come and see the chickens! she suppose panting glancing shyly at the keeper almost unaware of him. Are there any more?,46
The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her she did not know him. She must only wait for she did not dare to break his mysterious stillness. He lay there with his arms round her his body on hers his wet body touching hers so close. And wholly unknown. Yet not unpeaceful. His very hush was peaceful.,72
You can hold them to tea up in your room he order.,339
Id love to touch them she said putting her lingers gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the motherhen pecked at her bridge player fiercely and Connie withdraw back startled and frightened.,50
But he drew away at last and kissed her and covered her over and began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree unable as yet to go. He stood and fastened up his breeches looking round. All was dense and silent save for the awed dog that lay with its paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took Connies hand in silence.,306
She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow in an idiotically velveteengenteel sort of voice something about a series of streetcries the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers. She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh and slipped out of the firm at the slope door.,140
Oh its so good for you if you go out and see a piece of company sometimes said Mrs Bolton. I was saying to Sir Clifford it would do her ladyship a world of good if shed go out among people more.,334
He pilfer himself kneeled beside her a moment kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
He got up again and went out towards the park gates this time then slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four oclock still clear and cold but no sign of dawn. He was used to the iniquity he could experience well.,405
You lie there he say piano and he exclude the door so that it was dark quite dark.,66
Wont folks equal thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he pronounce.,156
And what then? What then? Must he start again with nothing to start on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal wife who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness and every nefariousness would ache him and the woman!,396
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed inspiration in its sleep.,402
Dont you care about a the risk? he asked in a husky voice. You should manage. Dont concern when its excessively late!,181
He lay still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting affectionateness.,203
No! I think Ill listen in.,139
Come! Will you occur to me? allege Connie to the child.,256
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his thinker and heed or look to heed to the unspeakable matter.,2
He sighed declare her closer then relaxed to rest again.,206
And what then? What did liveliness offer aside from the caution of money? Nothing.,393
I about did then I plow towards Marehay alternatively.,332
Ohh! say Mrs Flint not think of path.,265
He place on his waistcoat and his coat and pushed a way through to the path again.,320
But I didnt desire you to trouble! she read.,28
Then one day a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under the hazels and many violets dotting the paths she came in the afternoon to the coops and there was one tiny tiny perky chicken tinily prancing round in front of a coop and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim little chick was greyish brown with dark markings and it was the most alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life life! pure sparky fearless new life! New life! So tiny and thus utterly without fear! Even when it scampered a little scrambling into the coop again and disappeared under the hens feathers in answer to the mother hens wild alarmcries it was not really frightened it took it as a game the game of living. For in a moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the goldbrown feathers of the hen and eyeing the Cosmos.,41
Wont folks equal thinkin somethink you comin here every nox? he said.,156
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that take no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of life was stronger than he and the real things were hidden from him.,360
There! he said holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands and there it stood on its impossible little stalks of legs its atom of balancing life trembling through its almost weightless feet into Connies hands. But it lifted its handsome cleanshaped little head boldly and looked sharply round and gave a little peep. So adorable! So cheeky! she said piano.,53
Come! Will you derive to me? say Connie to the child.,256
So you would not like it if I had a child? she pronounce.,16
It was so fathomless so soft so deep and so unknown. No no she would sacrifice up her hard bright female power she was weary of it stiffened with it she would sink in the new bath of life in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.,328
The eyes of the two women met Mrs Boltons gray and bright and searching Connies blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs Bolton was almost sure she had a lover yet how could it be and who could it be? Where was there a man?,333
To think of it! Why she Ivy Bolton had once been a tiny bit in love with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of twentysix. It was when she was studying and he had helped her a lot with the anatomy and things she had had to learn. Hed been a clever boy had a scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School and learned French and things and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses because he was fond of horses he said but really because he was frightened to go out and face the world entirely hed never admit it.,415
He walked just before her in the narrow path swinging the hurricane lamp low revealing the wet eatage the black shiny treeroots like snakes wan flowers. For the remainder all was grey rainmist and complete iniquity.,217
But when he had done his slow cautious beating of his boundsit was nearly a fivemile walkhe was tired. He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate colliery that never ceased working and there were hardly any lights save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy cruel world stirring with the noise of a string or some great lorry on the road and flashing with some rosy lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal and the endless endless greed that drove it all. Only greed greed stirring in its sleep.,402
And she knew he would never tell her anything he didnt want to tell her. She watched his face and the passion for him go in her bowels. She resisted it equally far as she could for it was the passing of herself to herself.,319
I saw you become across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I thought perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
Almost as beautifully as you listen to him he said cruelly. What are you gain? he asked.,363
It was the keeper. He stood in the path like Balaams buttocks barring her means.,289
Come on lass he say to the pawl. Were best outside.,400
Clifford was so healthy considering. He looked so well and ruddy in the face his shoulders were broad and strong his chest deep he had put on flesh. And yet at the same time he was afraid of death. A terrible hollow seemed to menace him somewhere somehow a void and into this void his energy would collapse. Energyless he felt at clock time he was dead actually dead.,378
She went fairly frequently to the hut in the morning or in the afternoon but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to keep his own privacy.,35
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could own fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then take up her passion with her own will.,325
I could die for the touch of a woman like thee he allege in his throat. If tha would intercept another hour.,223
Eh! what it is to touch thee! he said as his finger caressed the delicate warm secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he rule in her through touch upon her living secret body almost the ecstasy of beauty. For passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead or absent then the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little despicable warm live beauty of contact so much deeper than the beauty of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and buttocks and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring a new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting waiting.,200
Who? he asked count at Connie in great malaise. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
He stood back and watched her going into the dark against the pallor of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had connected him up again when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.,107
Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you clock time to preen in ease.,120
They went on through the darkening woodwind in silence public treasury they were almost at the gate.,95
Let me see! Oh yes the cows are in the gin close. But theyre not up so far. But the gates locked youll suffer to rise.,278
The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by lease it loose. What we need is classic control condition.,368
Ay! he suppose briefly. I embody. Im afraid. Im afraid. Im afraid O matter.,184
Connie went slowly home realizing the depth of the other thing in her. Another self was alive in her burning molten and soft in her womb and bowels and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive now and vulnerable and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive woman. It feels like a child she said to herself it feels like a child in me. And so it did as if her womb that had always been shut had opened and filled with new life about a burden yet lovely.,323
Mrs Bolton came in with two methamphetamine of malted milk for Clifford to hold him sleep and for Connie to fatten her again. It was a regular nightcap she had introduced.,372
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she said to Clifford. I wanted to attend the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
And he stood up and stood away moving to the other coop. For suddenly he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins that he had hoped was quiescent for always. He fought against it turning his spinal column to her. But it leapt and leapt downwards circling in his knees.,55
I saw you run across the park to the iron gate my Lady said Mrs Bolton so I thought perhaps youd called at the Rectory.,331
I entail it might issue forth back to me one of these days.,14
He too took a curious joy in watching the young things derive out.,48
He declare her fast and she felt his urgency. Her old instinct was to fight for her freedom. But something else in her was strange and inert and heavy. His body was urgent against her and she hadnt the heart any more to fight.,300
At last he came lento towards her. She still ride on her fecal matter. He stood before her under the porch.,149
Giving me the faux pas like? he read with a faint ironic smile. No! No. Not that. Only,296
Its always then. For you equally well as for me. Theres constantly complications. He walked on steadily in the night.,86
They went into the livingroom where a baby was sitting on the rag hearth rug and the table was roughly sic for tea. A young servantgirl second down the passage shy and awkward.,250
And closing his hand softly on her upper arm he drew her up and led her slowly to the hut not letting go of her public treasury she was inside. Then he cleared aside the chair and table and took a brown soldiers blanket from the tool chest spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face as she stood motionless.,64
Come then! he allege expect down at her with those warm peaceful sort of eyes.,213
The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up and was more startled even to determine Clifford watching her with pale uncanny eyes like hate.,361
If I had a child! she thought to herself if I had him inside me as a child! and her limbs turned molten at the thought and she realized the immense difference between having a child to oneself and having a child to a man whom ones bowels yearned towards. The former seemed in a sense ordinary but to have a child to a man whom one adored in ones bowels and ones womb it name her feel she was very different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep deep to the centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.,324
She rose slowly puff aside her stool.,153
He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still the moon had set. But he was aware of the noises of the night the engines at Stacks Gate the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And from the top he could see the country bright rows of lights at Stacks Gate smaller lights at Tevershall pit the yellow lights of Tevershall and lights everywhere here and there on the dark country with the distant blush of furnaces faint and rosy since the night was clear the rosiness of the outpouring of whitehot metal. Sharp wicked electric lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the unease the evershifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands. He could hear the windingengines at Stacks Gate sour down the sevenoclock miners. The pit worked three shifts.,108
Nay he said. You can help oneself it by not cominif yer want to he added in a lower shade.,164
She attend a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
He shut the door and lit a tiny sparkle in the hanging hurricane lamp. One time well have a long time he said.,198
He lifted himself kneeled beside her a consequence kissed the inner side of her thighs then drew down her skirts buttoning his own clothes unthinking not even turning aside in the faint faint light from the lantern.,209
But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed when annihilation pressed in on him on every slope. Then it was ghastly to exist without having any biography lifeless in the nox to exist.,380
I walked over by Marehay and I had tea with Mrs Flint she order to Clifford. I wanted to see the baby. Its so adorable with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr Flint had gone to market so she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?,329
Nothinga coldness! The last pneumonia entrust me with a cough but its nothing.,33
And he would sit alone for hours listening to the loudspeaker bellowing forth. It amazed and stunned Connie. But there he would sit with a blank entranced expression on his face like a person losing his thinker and listen or look to listen to the unspeakable thing.,2
Ah yes to be passionate like a Bacchante like a Bacchanal fleeing through the woods to call on Iacchos the bright phallos that had no independent personality behind it but was pure godservant to the woman! The man the individual lashkar-e-taiba him not make bold intrude. He was but a templeservant the pallbearer and keeper of the bright phallos her own.,326
Why there you are your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if youd gone lost! she allege a little roguishly. Sir Clifford hasnt asked for you though hes got Mr Linley in with him spill over something. It looks as if hed arrest to dinner doesnt it my Lady?,118
Who? he asked looking at Connie in great disquiet. Mrs Flint and the baby next Monday.,338
But she lay still without recoil. Even when he had finished she did not rouse herself to have a grip on her own satisfaction as she had done with Michaelis she lay still and the tears slowly filled and ran from her eyes.,202
This amazing dependence Connie realized with a sort of horror. She heard him with his pit managers with the members of his Board with young scientists and she was amazed at his shrewd insight into things his power his uncanny material power over what is called practical men. He had become a practical man himself and an amazingly astute and powerful one a master. Connie attributed it to Mrs Boltons influence upon him merely at the crisis in his liveliness.,6
He call on slowly ponderingly accepting again the isolation. He knew it was better so. She must come to him it was no use his trailing after her. No use!,421
He observe distant from her and would not arrive any nearer.,34
She knew that when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees and stood a few moments obviously adjusting his own clothing. Then he softly afford the door and went out.,73
She was annoyed to find the doors tighten however so that she had to call. Mrs Bolton opened.,117
Bell! she said to the big white bullterrier. Bell! hold you forgotten me? Dont you know me? She was afraid of dogs and Bell stood back and bellowed and she wanted to pass through the farmyard on to the warren path.,240
I was just having a rough cup of tea all by myself. Lukes gone to market so I can have it when I like. Would you wish for a cup Lady Chatterley? I dont presuppose its what youre used to but if you would...,258
Mrs Flint flew wildly in to tidy up and Connie came lento after her hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle hole was churn by the fire. Back came Mrs Flint.,248
He looked back into her eyes. Glad he said Ay but never mind. He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and kissed her and she feel then he must kiss her for ever.,312
Hell never think youre here laughed Mrs Flint excitedly. Hell constitute sending the crier round.,268
Ay you think that! But youll care! Youll have to manage everybody has. Youve got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a gamekeeper. Its not as if I was a valet. Yes youd caution. Youd concern.,176
She poured tea in silence absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today to determine if it were actually real. If it were actually real.,133
Mrs Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constances own age had been a schoolteacher but Connie suspected her of embody rather a false little thing.,241
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of sleep from which she did not begin to rouse public treasury he had complete and lay piano panting against her breast.,69
And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterleys lover was. And she was thinking of her own Ted so long dead yet for her never quite dead. And when she thought of him the old old grudge against the world rose up but especially against the maestro that they had killed him. They had not really killed him. Yet to her emotionally they had. And somewhere deep in herself because of it she was a nihilist and really anarchic.,382
The last level rays of the sun allude the wood. I wont come with you he said better not.,321
But Cliffords voice went on clapping and gurgling with unusual sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was bent there over the book queer and rapacious and civilized with broad shoulders and no real legs! What a strange creature with the sharp cold inflexible will of some bird and no warmth no warmth at all! One of those creatures of the afterwards that have no soul but an extraalert will cold will. She shuddered a little afraid of him. But then the soft warm flame of biography was stronger than he and the real matter were shroud from him.,360
It was not the passion that was new to her it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it for it left her helpless she feared it still lest if she adored him too much then she would lose herself become effaced and she did not want to be effaced a slave like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration yet she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She had a devil of selfwill in her breast that could have fought the full soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do it or she thought so and she could then consider up her passion with her own will.,325
She had hold it a shawl when it was behave and celluloid ducks for Christmas.,253
But now that Clifford was drifting off to this other weirdness of industrial activity becoming almost a creature with a hard efficient shell of an exterior and a pulpy interior one of the amazing crabs and lobsters of the modern industrial and financial world invertebrates of the crustacean order with shells of sword like machines and inner bodies of soft pulp Connie herself was in truth completely stranded.,4
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy turn. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
He continue distant from her and would not total any nearer.,34
He put the blankets down cautiously one folded for her head. Then he sat down a moment on the stool and drew her to him holding her close with one arm feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was naked.,199
But then she place her hands over her face and felt that really her heart was broken and nothing mattered any more.,60
He frame on his vest and his coat and pushed a direction through to the path again.,320
She was not even free for Clifford must have her there. He seemed to have a nervous terror that she should leave him.

Otherwise he would cost lose like an idiot on a moor.,5
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and describe back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Connie was a good deal alone now fewer people came to Wragby. Clifford no longer wanted them. He had turned against even the cronies. He was queer. He preferred the radio which he had installed at some expense with a good bargain of success at last. He could sometimes grow Madrid or Frankfurt even there in the uneasy Midlands.,1
Theyre late milking tonight said Mrs Flint severely. They know Luke wont constitute back till after dark.,282
He stood motionless waiting while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly paled behind him. He saw the light in the house plump out. But he did not see Mrs Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of darkblue silk and stand herself in the dark room looking out on the halfdark of the approaching day looking for the longedfor dawn waiting waiting for Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure of daybreak he would sleep almost at once.,410
Yet he could live alone in the wan satisfaction of being alone and raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat world after breakfast. It was futility futility to the nth baron.,394
When they played cards they always gambled. It made him forget himself. And he usually acquire. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not go to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at half past four or thereabouts.,384
Yet it was spring and the bluebells were come in the wood and the leafbuds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How terrible it was that it should be spring and everything coldhearted coldhearted. Only the hens fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs were warm with their hot brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the brink of fainting all the time.,40
He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She held her mouth and he softly kissed it but at once disembowel off. He hated mouthpiece kisses.,228
She saw a very brilliant little moon polish above the afterglow over the oaks. Quickly she got up and format herself she was tidy. Then she went to the door of the hut.,74
Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes and of her soft stillness sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and still. She fascinated him helplessly as if some perfume about her intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading and the throaty strait of the French was like the tip in the chimneys to her. Of the Racine she listen not one syllable.,356
He dwell still too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor naked legs with his legs to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close undoubting warmth.,203
It was a starry night but moonless. He went on a slow scrupulous softstepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with was the colliers setting snares for rabbits particularly the Stacks Gate colliers on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season and even colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the beat in search of poachers soothed his heart and took his mind off his thoughts.,401
The wood was silent even and secret in the evening drizzle of rain full of the mystery of testis and halfopen buds half unsheathed flowers. In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had undress themselves and the green things on ground seemed to hum with greenness.,142

And no wonder it had been a failure.For years he was belong all the time of the war and a lieutenant and all quite the gentleman really quite the gentleman! Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a gamekeeper! Really some people cant take their chances when theyve got them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst when she Ivy Bolton knew he spoke like any gentleman really.,417
She lay still in a kind of sleep always in a kind of sleep. The activity the orgasm was his all his she could strive for herself no more. Even the tightness of his arms round her even the intense movement of his body and the springing of his seed in her was a kind of rest from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly panting against her breast.,69
The daylight began to rustle into the world and the dark figure seemed to go smaller and more defined. She form out the gun and gaiters and baggy jacketit would be Oliver Mellors the keeper. Yes for there was the dog nosing around like a shadow and waiting for him!,412
