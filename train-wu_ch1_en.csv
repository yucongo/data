Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,21
What the devil is the topic? he asked eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable discussion.,22
No wonder the grass mature up between the flags and cattle be the only hedgecutters.,11
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you plump at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful state! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,3
Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here take a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my cad I am willing to own hardly know how to receive them. Your health sir!,29

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have hold a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,14

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must hold up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,13

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might receive guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,17
One step brought us into the kin sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
No wonder the grass develop up between the masthead and cattle constitute the only hedgecutters.,11
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a catch. My caress harass a long guttural gnarl.,18

The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation have no reference to my unexpected advent.,12
Before legislate the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,14
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar dance step with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,21

I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a battalion of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,30
Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sunday. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,13
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visÃ vis the ruffianly cunt and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,20

I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation therefore completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,3
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,18
When he saw my horses breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court Joseph consume Mr Lockwoods horse and bring up some wine.,9

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you travel at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me.

And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from social station of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15

Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation take no character to my unexpected second coming.,12

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my beloved vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,17
Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs brood. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,13
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visÃ vis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some go of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,20
I bring a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch.

Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw.

I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the devastation between us. A capital fellow!

While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea seashore I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp.

Here we have the whole establishment of domestics I suppose was the reflection hint by this compound ordering.,10
Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I induce not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts,6
Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here lead a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs I am willing to own hardly know how to receive them. Your health sir!,29
Youd well let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a pet. Then striding to a side door he shouted again Joseph!,19
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete passing and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,14
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord boost and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,18
What the devil indeed! I muttered. The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse liveliness in them than those animals of yours sir. You might as well bequeath a stranger with a brood of tigers!,23

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart arm set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of clapper and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar gradation with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,21

When he saw my horses breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court Joseph take Mr Lockwoods cavalry and institute up some wine.,9
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visÃ vis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to total in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,20

Come come he said you are flurried Mr Lockwood. Here take a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my andiron I am willing to own hardly know how to receive them. Your health sir!,29

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after course on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn.

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One goal indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the firm preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her overlord entered on the scene.,21
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation accept no reference to my unexpected advent.,12

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you start at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering course after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
I subscribe a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch.

Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had get some opinion,6
The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs determine out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a darling. Then striding to a english door he exclaim again Joseph!,19

Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her headmaster entered on the scene.,21

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a yak of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had have some idea,6
Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure stimulate ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,13

I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks.

Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be attend in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and practice that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,21
One dance step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would constitute a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visÃ vis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements.

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs plant out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the conclusion of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,13

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed chew over splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof.

Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must receive up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun.

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the rung table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,3
Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have induce a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,14
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she merely remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,21
A nod constitute the answer.,5
What the devil cost the matter? he asked eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.,22
Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the root cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visÃ vis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,20

Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no character to my unexpected second coming.,12
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and be sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,18
I bowed and returned the assurance beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,30
One gradation brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15

Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had hold some thoughts,6

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen construct more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,21
The apartment and furniture would have cost nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

Youd better let the dog alone growled Mr Heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. Shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a pet. Then stride to a slope door he shouted again Joseph!,19

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station constitute exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,13

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering exist a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,13

I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I make not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow!

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs fix out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me.

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master record on the scene.,21

Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in woo the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts,6

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but grant no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visÃ vis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,20

One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I respect no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15

The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters.

Before passing the threshold I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have stool a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,14

Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of rise so his master dived down to him leaving me visÃ vis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker I was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.,20
No wonder the grass mature up between the pin and cattle equal the only hedgecutters.,11
Joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. The Lord help us! he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while excuse me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent.,12
One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter smasher interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
No wonder the grass mature up between the iris and cattle be the only hedgecutters.,11
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and meet up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,18
I have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropists heaven and Mr Heathcliff and I embody such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as I rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as I announced my name.,3
Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you had give birth some opinion,6
Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed boldness rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,21
I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would cost foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,30
Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliffs dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure bracing ventilation they must take up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,13
When he saw my horses breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hired hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court Joseph take Mr Lockwoods horse and bring up some wine.,9

Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs I sat still but imagining they would barely understand tacit insults I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us.

He is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. Possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort I know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. Hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No Im running on too fast I bestow my own attributes over liberally on him. Mr Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.,16

One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it.

Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.,13
Mr Lockwood your new tenant sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange I heard yesterday you receive had some thoughts,6

Here we have the whole establishment of domestics I suppose was the reflection hint by this compound holy order.,10
No wonder the grass develop up between the flags and cattle constitute the only hedgecutters.,11
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. I never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have think I was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved I alone can appreciate.,17

One footstep brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. The latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.,15
What the monster is the topic? he asked eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.,22
What the devil cost the topic? he necessitate eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.,22
They wont meddle with persons who touch nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table. The dogs do right to be vigilant. Take a methamphetamine of wine?,24
Thrushcross Grange is my own sir he interrupted wincing. I should not let anyone to inconvenience me if I could obstruct itwalk in!,7
What the devil indeed! I muttered. The herd of possessed swine could have give birth no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours sir. You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!,23
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposition that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.,18
One step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory anteroom or passage they call it here the house preeminently. It includes kitchen and parlour generally but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and I observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.

I bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn. Heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the stupidity of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before I went home I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.,30
Before passing the brink I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys I detected the date 1500 and the name Hareton Earnshaw. I would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.,14

Mr Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm I dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth be an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.,21
